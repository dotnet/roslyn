## Introduction

This directory contains custom build tools.

## Building

Use the `Build.ps1` script.

## Using the tools

In most use cases, these tools are not used individually, but are used as a class library from the main build C# project of the repo.

However, to run the tools individually, do this:

1. Build the tools. (See above.)

2. Run the tool. See the help.

   ```tools\postsharp-eng```
