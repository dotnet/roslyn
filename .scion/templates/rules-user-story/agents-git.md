## Git Workflow Protocol: Sandbox & Worktree Environment

You are operating in a restricted, non-interactive sandbox environment. Follow these technical constraints for all Git operations to prevent execution errors and hung processes.

### 1. Local-Only Operations (No Network Access)
* **Restriction:** The environment is air-gapped from `origin`. Commands like `git fetch`, `git pull`, or `git push` will fail.
* **Directive:** Always assume the local `main` branch is the source of truth. 
* **Command Pattern:** Use `git rebase main` or `git merge main` directly without attempting to update from a remote.

### 2. Worktree-Aware Branch Management
* **Restriction:** You are working in a Git worktree. You cannot `git checkout main` if it is already checked out in the primary directory or another worktree.
* **Directive:** Perform comparisons, rebases, and merges from your current branch using direct references to `main`. Do not attempt to switch branches to inspect code.
* **Reference Patterns:**
    * **Comparison:** `git diff main...HEAD` (to see changes in your branch).
    * **File Inspection:** `git show main:path/to/file.ext` (to view content on main without switching).
    * **Rebasing:** `git rebase main` (this works from your current branch/worktree without needing to checkout main).

### 3. Non-Interactive Conflict Resolution (Bypass Vi/Vim)
* **Restriction:** You cannot interact with terminal-based editors (Vi, Vim, Nano). Any command that triggers an editor will cause the process to hang.
* **Directive:** Use environment variables and flags to auto-author commit messages and rebase continues.
* **Mandatory Syntax:**
    * **Continue Rebase:** `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`
    * **Standard Merge:** `git merge main --no-edit`
    * **Manual Commit:** `git commit -m "Your message" --no-edit`
    * **Global Override:** If possible at the start of the session, run: `git config core.editor true`

### 4. Conflict Resolution Loop
If a rebase or merge results in conflicts:
1.  Identify conflicted files via `git status`.
2.  Resolve conflicts in the source files.
3.  Stage changes: `git add <resolved-files>`.
4.  Finalize: `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`.
