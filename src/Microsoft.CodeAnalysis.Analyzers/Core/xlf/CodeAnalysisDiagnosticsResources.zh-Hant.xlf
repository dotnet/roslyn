        <source>An analyzer start action enables performing stateful analysis over a given code unit, such as a code block, compilation, etc. Careful design is necessary to achieve efficient analyzer execution without memory leaks. Use the following guidelines for writing such analyzers:
1. Define a new scope for the registered start action, possibly with a private nested type for analyzing each code unit.
2. If required, define and initialize state in the start action.
3. Register at least one non-end action that refers to this state in the start action. If no such action is necessary, consider replacing the start action with a non-start action. For example, a CodeBlockStartAction with no registered actions or only a registered CodeBlockEndAction should be replaced with a CodeBlockAction.
4. If required, register an end action to report diagnostics based on the final state.
