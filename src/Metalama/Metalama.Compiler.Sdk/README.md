The `Metalama.Compiler.Sdk` package defines the `ISourceTransformer` interface as well as other APIs that allow you to write source transformers for `Metalama.Compiler`.

You should normally not need to reference this package directly. To develop a low-level aspect weaver for Metalama, use the `Metalama.Framework.Sdk` package.
