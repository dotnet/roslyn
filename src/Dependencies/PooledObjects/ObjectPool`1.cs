    /// 1) it is not the goal to keep all returned objects. Pool is not meant for storage. If there
    ///    is no space in the pool, extra returned objects will be dropped.
    /// 
    /// 2) it is implied that if object was obtained from a pool, the caller will return it back in
    ///    a relatively short time. Keeping checked out objects for long durations is ok, but 
    ///    reduces usefulness of pooling. Just new up your own.
    /// 
    /// Not returning objects to the pool in not detrimental to the pool's work, but is a bad practice.

    ///    If there is no intent for reusing the object, do not use pool - just use "new".
