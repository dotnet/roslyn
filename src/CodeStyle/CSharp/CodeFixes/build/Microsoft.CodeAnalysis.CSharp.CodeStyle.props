  <!-- 
    PropertyGroup to disable built-in CodeStyle analyzers from .NET SDK that have the identical IDE rules to those implemented in this package.
    This props file should only be present in the analyzer NuGet package, it should **not** be inserted into the .NET SDK.
    In future, if we need to insert a CodeStyle props file into the .NET SDK, we should move out the below property group into a separate props file
    which is not inserted into the .NET SDK.

    NOTE: Keep this file in sync with 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.VisualBasic.CodeStyle.props'
