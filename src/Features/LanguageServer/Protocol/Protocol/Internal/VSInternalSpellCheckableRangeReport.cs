        /// 2. Each span is defined by a set of 3 ordered integers in the <see cref="Ranges"/> property.
        /// 3. The span's ordered information are the following:
        ///     1. A kind, corresponding to the numeric value of <see cref="VSInternalSpellCheckableRangeKind"/>.
        ///     2. A start position, which is the character index where the span starts in the document buffer.
        ///        The start position should be the relative offset from the end of the previous span, regardless of whether that span is the same range
        ///        or a prior range.
        ///     3. The length of the span.
        /// 4. Spans should be ordered by their absolute start position in the document buffer.
