/// <summary>
/// Interface to indicate that a workspace wants to customize what happens in the lsp server when lsp contents for a
/// file are updated by an lsp client. In VS, for example, we have a non-mutating workspace.  The VS workspace itself is
/// updated automatically with the real contents of buffers, and by tracking the running-doc-table.  Changes that come
/// in through LSP do not impact this actual workspace.  Instead, the <see cref="LspWorkspaceManager"/> creates an
/// overlay, where it uses the <see cref="Solution"/> snapshot from the VS workspace, but then forks it in any cases
/// where it's view of the world may differ from LSP (which can happen as LSP is async, and so may represent a state of
/// the world that is slightly different from what the VS workspace thinks it is.
/// <para/>
/// For hosts though where there is no external source of truth (for example, a server that might host roslyn directly,
/// where all info comes from LSP), this enables LSP to 'push through' file changes directly to the to the workspace's
/// model. That way, the workspace's solution is always in sync with what LSP thinks it is (at least for open
/// documents).
/// <para/>
/// It is fine for external changes to happen to the contents of documents within the workspace (see <see
/// cref="Workspace.OnDocumentTextChanged(Document)"/>).  However, they will be overwritten by the <see
/// cref="LspWorkspaceManager"/> for any changed documents it knows about (through <see
