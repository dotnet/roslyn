            //    that calls to it cannot overlap, and it doesn't have to worry about threading.
            //
            // 2. We specifically only want the updated solution at the start of a request. If the solution provider
            //    handed out "the right" solution, then a request could ask it for something at the start of processing
            //    and at the end of processing, and get different results each time.
