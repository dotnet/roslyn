        /// contained a <see cref="Compilation"/> that could have produced that symbol.  This is especially needed with
        /// OOP scenarios where we have to communicate to OOP from VS (And vice versa) what symbol we are referring to.
        /// To do this, we pass along a project where this symbol could be found, and enough information (a <see
