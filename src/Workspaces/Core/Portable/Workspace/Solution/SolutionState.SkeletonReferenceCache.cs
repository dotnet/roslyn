    /// to allow cross-language project references with live semantic updating between VB/C# and vice versa.
    /// Specifically, in a cross language case we will build a skeleton ref for the referenced project and have the
    /// referrer use that to understand its semantics.
    /// <para>
    /// This approach works, but has the caveat that live cross-language semantics are only possible when the skeleton
    /// assembly can be built.  This should always be the case for correct code, but it may not be the case for code
    /// with errors depending on if the respective language compiler is resilient to those errors or not. In that case
    /// though where the skeleton cannot be built, this type provides mechanisms to fallback to the last successfully
    /// built skeleton so that a somewhat reasonable experience can be maintained.  If we failed to do this and instead
    /// returned nothing, a user would find that practically all semantic experiences that depended on that particular
    /// project would fail or be seriously degraded (e.g. diagnostics).  To that end, it's better to limp along with
    /// stale date, then barrel on ahead with no data.
    /// </para>

    /// The implementation works by keeping metadata references around associated with a specific <see
    /// cref="VersionStamp"/> for a project. As long as the <see cref="Project.GetDependentSemanticVersionAsync"/> for
    /// that project is the same, then all the references of it can be reused.  When an <see
    /// cref="ICompilationTracker"/> forks itself, it will also <see cref="Clone"/> this, allowing previously computed
    /// references to be used by later forks. However, this means that later forks (esp. ones that fail to produce a
    /// skeleton, or which produce a skeleton for different semantics) will not leak backward to a prior <see
    /// cref="ProjectState"/>, causing it to see a view of the world inapplicable to its current snapshot.  A downside
    /// of this is that if a fork happens to a compilation tracker *prior* to the skeleton for it being computed, then
    /// when the skeleton is actually produced it won't be shared forward.  In practice the hope is that this is rare,
    /// and that eventually the compilation trackers will have computed the skeleton and will be able to pass it forward
    /// from that point onwards.

    /// compute the skeleton information for that tracker, we hold onto it for as long as the tracker is itself alive.

    /// downstream projects of different languages that reference this.  The only time this won't hold true is if there
    /// was a cross language p2p ref, but then it gets removed from the solution.  However, this sort of change should
