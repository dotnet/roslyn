/// <remarks>
/// Assembly path is used as a part of a generator identity to deal with the case that the user accidentally installed
/// the same generator twice from two different paths, or actually has two different generators that just happened to
/// use the same name. In the wild we've seen cases where a user has a broken project or build that results in the same
/// generator being added twice; we aren't going to try to deduplicate those anywhere since currently the compiler
/// does't do any deduplication either: you'll simply get duplicate outputs which might collide and cause compile
/// errors. If https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/56619 is addressed, we can potentially match the compiler
/// behavior by taking a different approach here.
