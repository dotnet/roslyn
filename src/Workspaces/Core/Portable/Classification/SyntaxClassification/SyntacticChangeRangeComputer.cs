    /// technically linear in the number of nodes and tokens that may need to examined.  However, in practice, it should
    /// operate in sub-linear time as it will bail the moment tokens don't match, and it's able to skip over matching
    /// nodes fully without examining the contents of those nodes.  This is intended for consumers that want a
    /// reasonably accurate change range computer, but do not want to spend an inordinate amount of time getting the
    /// most accurate and minimal result possible.

    /// This computation is not guaranteed to be minimal.  It may return a range that includes parts that are unchanged.
    /// This means it is also legal for the change range to just specify the entire file was changed. The quality of
    /// results will depend on how well the parsers did with incremental parsing, and how much time is given to do the
    /// comparison.  In practice, for large files (i.e. 15kloc) with standard types of edits, this generally returns
    /// results in around 50-100 usecs on a i7 3GHz desktop.
