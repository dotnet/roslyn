            // see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance.
            //
            // The optimized version uses insights from Ukonnen to greatly diminish the amount
            // of work that needs to be done. http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/InfCont85.PDF
            //
            // First, because we only need the distance, and don't need the path, we can do the 
            // standard approach of not requiring a full matrix to store all our edit distances.
            // 
            // Second, because a threshold is provided, we only need to search the values in
            // matrix that are within threshold distance away from the diagonal.  Any paths
            // outside that diagonal would necessarily have an edit distance that was greater
            // than the threshold and thus can be avoided.  i.e. if we have a matrix like
            //
#if false
            -------------
            | abcdefghij|
            |m          |
            |n          |
            |o          |
            -------------

            Then the two relevant diagonals are

            -------------
            | abcdefghij|
            |m\      \  |
            |n \      \ |
            |o  \      \|
            -------------

            And we can cap the search past the diagonals based on the threshold.  For larger strings
            With a small threshold, this can be very valuable.  For example, if we had 10 char strings
            with a a threshold of 2, we'd only have to search

            -------------
            | abcdefghij|
            |m\**       |
            |n*\**      |
            |o**\**     |
            |p **\**    |
            |q  **\**   |
            |r   **\**  |
            |s    **\** |
            |t     **\**|
            |u      **\*|
            |v       **\|
            -------------

            Which greatly decreases the search space.  Any items outside of this range will necessarily
            have a higher cost than our threshold and thus don't even need to be considered.

            // Third, instead of taking the swapping approach often found in algorithms that 
            // go a row at a time through the matrix, we can take avantage of the fact that
            // we know we're always sweeping the matrix from top to bottom and from left to
            // right.  In that case, as we're producing new row values, we can store it in 
            // the existing row.  However, we make sure to just keep around the values we're
            // about to overwrite so we can use them as we continue to populate the row.

            //
            // Note: because we do look for characater twiddling, we do need to keep around

            // of three.

            // Fourth, we do fast scans to see if our strings share any common prefix/suffix
            // portions.  These portions of the string correspond to a 0 edit cost.  We then
            // only have to do the string edit distance on the portion of the strings that
            // don't match.
            //
            // Fifth, to avoid lots of overhead indexing into strings and converting their
            // characters to lowercase, we do a prepass over the string and convert it to
            // a lowercase char array.  We also pool these arrays to avoid the allocations.
            // By doing this, we only need to convert characters once, and we can then 
            // access the characters extremely quickly from teh array.
            //
            // Sixth, we optimize for the case where we will be comparing a single string
            // against many potential match strings.  We cache the information about the 
            // single string (such as it's lower-case char array) so that we don't have to
            // recompute it.
            //
            // With all these changes we see an improvement of about 20x when computing the
            // edit distance for strings.  In practical terms, what was 4 seconds of searching

            //          and having an array for the previous column as well.  
            //          
            //          However, we can be a bit smarter and use a single array.  How?  Well, instead of writing 
            //          the new values into a new column, we can write it right back into the column we're currently
            //          traversing.  After all, if we're writing into (i, j), then (i-1, j) is just the current value
            //          in the cell.  (i, j-1) is the value in the cell right above us that we just computed before 
            //          this cell.  And (i-1, j-1) is the value in the cell right above *before* we computed the 
            //          new value for it.  The only trickyness is we have to store the value of the cell above us
            //          in a temporary before we overwrite it.  Now we have access to all three values we need to
            //          compute the new (i,j) value.
            //
            //          No, we do something similar for twiddling. However, because a twiddle cost is "1 + (i-2, j-2)"
            //          we need to keep around our i-2 values.  We can't do that if we're overwriting all the values
            //          in the column.  So we do keep around one additional column for the i-2 generation.
