'name1' is the current group (optional), 'name2' is a previously defined group, and 'subexpression' is any valid regular expression pattern. The balancing group definition deletes the definition of name2 and stores the interval between name2 and name1 in name1. If no name2 group is defined, the match backtracks. Because deleting the last definition of name2 reveals the previous definition of name2, this construct lets you use the stack of captures for group name2 as a counter for keeping track of nested constructs such as parentheses or opening and closing brackets.

The balancing group definition uses 'name2' as a stack. The beginning character of each nested construct is placed in the group and in its Group.Captures collection. When the closing character is matched, its corresponding opening character is removed from the group, and the Captures collection is decreased by one. After the opening and closing characters of all nested constructs have been matched, 'name1' is empty.</source>

A zero-width negative lookahead assertion is typically used either at the beginning or at the end of a regular expression. At the beginning of a regular expression, it can define a specific pattern that should not be matched when the beginning of the regular expression defines a similar but more general pattern to be matched. In this case, it is often used to limit backtracking. At the end of a regular expression, it can define a subexpression that cannot occur at the end of a match.</source>

Zero-width negative lookbehind assertions are typically used at the beginning of regular expressions. The pattern that they define precludes a match in the string that follows.

Typically, a zero-width positive lookahead assertion is found at the end of a regular expression pattern. It defines a substring that must be found at the end of a string for a match to occur but that should not be included in the match. It is also useful for preventing excessive backtracking. You can use a zero-width positive lookahead assertion to ensure that a particular captured group begins with text that matches a subset of the pattern defined for that captured group.</source>
