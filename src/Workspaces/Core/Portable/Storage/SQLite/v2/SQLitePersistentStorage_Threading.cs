        /// <para/>
        /// Thread A starts a transaction that starts as a reader, and later attempts to perform a
        /// write. Thread B is a writer (either started that way, or started as a reader and
        /// promoted to a writer first). B holds a RESERVED lock, waiting for readers to clear so it
        /// can start writing. A holds a SHARED lock (it's a reader) and tries to acquire RESERVED
        /// lock (so it can start writing).  The only way to make progress in this situation is for
        /// one of the transactions to roll back. No amount of waiting will help, so when SQLite
        /// detects this situation, it doesn't honor the busy timeout.
        /// <para/>
        /// To prevent this scenario, we control our access to the db explicitly with operations that
        /// can concurrently read, and operations that exclusively write.

        /// solution.  These will all end up sharing the same DB file on disk.  That in itself is not an issue as sqlite
        /// is fine with a DB file being opened multiple times.  However, we do need to coordinate with ourself to
        /// ensure that no two threads collide trying to write to the same table at the same time (or one thread trying
        /// to read, while another writes to a table).  By only allowing one write to happen across all DBs within a
        /// single process, we eliminate that concern.
