        // 1. Initial use of sqlite as the persistence layer.  Simple key->value storage tables.
        // 2. Updated to store checksums.  Tables now key->(checksum,value).  Allows for reading
        //    and validating checksums without the overhead of reading the full 'value' into
        //    memory.
        // 3. Use an in-memory DB to cache writes before flushing to disk.
        // 4. Store checksums directly inline (i.e. 20 bytes), instead of usign ObjectWriter serialization (which adds
        //    more data to the checksum).

        /// manner as we can use those IDs instead of duplicating strings all over the place.  For
        /// example, there may be many pieces of data associated with a file.  We don't want to
        /// key off the file path in all these places as that would cause a large amount of bloat.

        /// Because the string table can map from arbitrary strings to unique IDs, it can also be

        /// and Name of a Project, we can get an ID that represents the project itself by just
        /// creating a compound key of those two IDs.  This ID can then be used in other compound
