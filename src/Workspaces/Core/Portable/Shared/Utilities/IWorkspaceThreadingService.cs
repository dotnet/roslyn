    /// <para>For Visual Studio, Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading provides the JoinableTaskFactory.Run method, which is
    /// the expected way to invoke an asynchronous method from a synchronous entry point and block on its completion.

    /// allow callers to simply use <see cref="Task.Wait()"/>.</para>
