    /// When cascading if we should only travel in a consistent direction away from the starting symbol.  For
    /// example, starting on a virtual method, this would cascade upwards to implemented interface methods, and
    /// downwards to overridden methods.  However, it would not then travel back down to other implementations of
    /// those interface methods.  This is useful for cases where the client only wants references that could lead to
    /// this symbol actually being called into at runtime.
    /// 
    /// There are cases where a client will not want this behavior.  An example of that is 'Rename'.  In rename,
    /// there is a implicit link between members in a hierarchy with the same name (and appropriate signature).  For example, in:
    ///
    /// <code>
    /// interface I { void Goo(); }
    /// class C1 : I { public void Goo() { } }
    /// class C2 : I { public void Goo() { } }

    /// If <c>C1.Goo</c> is renamed, this will need to rename <c>C2.Goo</c> as well to keep the code properly
    /// compiling.  So, by default 'Rename' will cascade to all of these so it can appropriately update them.  This
    /// option is the more relevant with knowing if a particular reference would actually result in a call to the
    /// original member, not if it has a relation to the original member.
