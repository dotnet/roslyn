/// The RPC system implemented here is pretty close to something like JSON-RPC; however since we need the Build Host to be usable in Source Build
/// scenarios, we are limited to using only what is either in .NET or can be easily made buildable in Source Build. Thus existing solutions like StreamJsonRpc 
/// are out. If at some point there is a standard RPC mechanism exposed in .NET or Source Build, we should delete this and use that instead.
