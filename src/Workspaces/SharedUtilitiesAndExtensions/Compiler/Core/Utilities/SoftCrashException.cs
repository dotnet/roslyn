    /// this represents soft crash request compared to hard crash which will bring down VS.
    /// 
    /// by soft crash, it means everything same as hard crash except it should use NFW and info bar
    /// to inform users about unexpected condition instead of killing VS as traditional crash did.
    /// 
    /// in other words, no one should ever try to recover from this exception. but they must try to not hard crash.
    /// 
    /// this exception is based on cancellation exception since, in Roslyn code, cancellation exception is so far
    /// only safest exception to throw without worrying about crashing VS 99%. there is still 1% case it will bring
    /// down VS and those places should be guarded on this exception as we find such place.
    /// 
    /// for now, this is an opt-in based. if a feature wants to move to soft crash (ex, OOP), one should catch
    /// exception and translate that to this exception and then add handler which report NFW and info bar in their
    /// code path and make sure it doesn't bring down VS.
    /// 
    /// as we use soft-crash in more places, we should come up with more general framework.
