/// <summary>
/// Contains the utilities for writing assets from the host to a pipe-writer and for reading those assets on the
/// server.  The format we use is as follows.  For each asset we're writing we write:
/// <code>
/// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// | sentinel (1 byte) | length of data (4 bytes) | data (variable length) |
/// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// </code>
/// The writing code will write out the sentinel-byte and data-length, ensuring it is flushed to the pipe-writer. This
/// allows the pipe-reader to immediately read that information so it can then pre-allocate the space for the data to go
/// into. After writing the data the writer will also flush, so the reader can then read the data out of the pipe into
/// its buffer.  Once present in the reader's buffer, synchronous deserialization can happen without any sync-over-async
/// blocking on async-io.
/// <para/> The sentinel byte serves to let us detect immediately on the reading side if something has gone wrong with
/// this system.
/// <para/> In order to be able to write out the data-length, the writer will first synchronously write the asset to an
/// in-memory buffer, then write that buffer's length to the pipe-writer, then copy the in-memory buffer to the writer.
/// <para/> When writing/reading the data-segment, we use an the <see cref="ObjectWriter"/>/<see cref="ObjectReader"/>
/// subsystem.  This will write its own validation bits, and then the data describing the asset.  This data is:
/// <code>
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// | data (variable length)                                                                                 |
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// | ObjectWriter validation (2 bytes) | checksum (16 bytes) | kind (1 byte) | asset-data (asset specified) |
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// </code>
/// The validation bytes are followed by the checksum.  The checksum is needed in the message as assets can be found in
/// any order (they are not reported in the order of the array of checksums passed into the writing method). Following
/// this is the kind of the asset.  This kind is used by the reading code to know which asset-deserialization routine to
/// invoke. Finally, the asset data itself is written out.
