    /// The netcore version of <see cref="RemoteControlClient"/> doesn't support ReturnStale.  It will download the file
    /// (on a separate thread), but then not cache it because it doesn't have access to the normal IE component that
    /// does proper header reading/caching.  Then, when we call in to read the file, we get nothing back, since nothing
    /// was cached.
    /// <para/> The temporary solution to this is to force the download to happen.  This is not ideal as we will no
    /// longer be respecting the server "Cache-Control:Max-Age" header.  Which means we'll continually download the
    /// files, even if not needed (since the server says to use the local value).  This is not great, but is not
    /// terrible either.  First, we will only download the full DB file <em>once</em>, when it is actually missing on
    /// the user's machine.  From that point on, we'll only be querying the server for the delta-patch file for the DB
    /// version we have locally.  The vast majority of the time that is a tiny document of the form <c><![CDATA[<Patch
    /// upToDate="true" FileVersion="105" ChangesetId="1CBE1453" />]]></c> (around 70 bytes) which simply tells the user
    /// they are up to date.  Only about once every three months will they actually download a large patch file.  Also,
    /// this patch download will only happen once a day tops (as that is our cadence for checking if there are new index
    /// versions out).
    /// <para/> https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/71014 tracks this issue.  Once RemoteControlClient is updated to
    /// support this again, we can remove this specialized code for netcore.
