            // When we create an LSP server, we compute our server capabilities; this may depend on
            // reading things like workspace options which will force us to initialize our option persisters.
            // Unfortunately some of our option persisters currently assert they are first created on the UI
            // thread. If the first time they're created is because of LSP initialization, we might end up loading
            // them on a background thread which will throw exceptions and then prevent them from being created
            // again later.
            //

            // asserting a MEF component is constructed on the foreground thread is never allowed, but alas it's
            // done there. Fixing that isn't difficult but comes with some risk I don't want to take for 16.9;
            // instead we'll just compute our capabilities here on the UI thread to ensure everything is loaded.

            // VS API that is following VS Threading rules, and it also ensures that the preereqs are loaded
            // prior to any RPC calls being made.
