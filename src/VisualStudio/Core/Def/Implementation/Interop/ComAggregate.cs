        /// on the fact that COM type equality is based on GUID, whereas type equality is identity in 
        /// the managed world.
        /// Example: IMethodXML is defined many times throughout VS and used by many managed clients
        ///          dealing with CodeFunction objects. If the CodeFunction objects they deal with are
        ///          direct references to managed objects, then casts operations are managed casts
        ///          (as opposed to QI calls), and they fail, since the managed type for IMethodXML
        ///          have different identity (since they are defined in different assemblies). The QI
        ///          works, since under the hood, the casts operations are converted to QI with 
        ///          a GUID which is shared between all these types.
