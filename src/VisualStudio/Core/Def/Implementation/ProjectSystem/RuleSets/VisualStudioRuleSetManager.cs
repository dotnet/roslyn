            // 2. The RuleSetFile was modified, and we want to get rid of our cache now. Anybody still holding onto the values will dispose at their leaisure,
            //    but it won't really matter anyways since the Dispose() that cleans up file trackers is already done.
            //
            // In either case, we can just be lazy and remove the key/value pair. It's possible in the mean time that the rule set had already been removed
            // (perhaps by a file change), and we're removing a live instance. This is fine, as this doesn't affect correctness: we consider this to be a cache
            // and if two callers got different copies that's fine. We *could* fetch the item out of the dictionary, check if the item is strong and then compare,
            // but that seems overkill.
