    /// The compiler server is a long lived process and loads analyzers from a series of build 
    /// commands. This type is responsible for ensuring that analyzers loaded into the server 
    /// match, as closely as possible, what would be loaded from a single invocation of csc / vbc.
    ///
    /// There are a few type of events that can lead to incorrect <see cref="Assembly"/> loads:
    ///
    ///  1. <see cref="AppDomain"/> pollution: On .NET Framework all analyzers are loaded into the same 
    ///     <see cref="AppDomain"/> instance. When analyzers have dependencies at different versions 
    ///     that can lead to them binding to different dependencies than they would through a single 
    ///     invocation of csc.
    ///  2. File system changes: The implementations of <see cref="IAnalyzerAssemblyLoader"/> assume 
    ///     that the file system is unchanged during build. If the file system does change (say if 
    ///     an analyzer is rebuilt) then the new instances need to be loaded not the previous ones.
    ///
    /// When these type of events happen the consistency checker should fail.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The fact that <see cref="IAnalyzerAssemblyLoader"/> believe the file system is unchanging
    /// makes sense for environments like IDEs but makes little sense for a build server. A  possible
    /// future improvement is reworking the server implementation to be resilient to file system
    /// changing events. At least on .NET Core that could lead to less server restarts.
