    // This is an unusual implementation of a mutable set. We sometimes have to take
    // the unions or intersections of sets using a custom equality comparator.
    // If the comparison says that two items are "equal" we nevertheless may 
    // express a preference for one or the other to be the one that "wins" and
    // ultimately ends up in the set. All equal items are equal, but some are more 
    // equal than others.
    //
    // In particular, we may have to make an arbitrary choice amongst several
    // possibilities, and it does not matter to the user which choice we make.
    // However, whichever choice we make should be *repeatable*. Compiling the
    // same program twice should produce the same errors, even if some of those
    // errors were chosen arbitrarily. 
    //
    // For example, when a lambda has been bound a dozen ways and it has failed
    // each time with "no method Blah on int", "... on string", "... on double",
    // we want to choose one of those errors to report. It does not matter which,
    // but to ensure that our test cases and user experience are stable, we need
    // a consistent way to choose one of them that does not rely on subtleties
    // of source-code ordering or implementation details of collection types.
