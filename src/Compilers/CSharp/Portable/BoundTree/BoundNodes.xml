 Important things to know about reference types, value types, and nulls.

 By default, all fields of reference type are checked (in debug) to be non-null.
 This can be modified by used the "Null" attribute, which can be one of the following values:
     disallow (default) - disallow null values
     allow - allow null values
     always - always null - only used in an override to indicate that this subclass always sets this field to null.
     notApplicable - its a value type, so it cannot be null
 
 In order to generate code, the generator needs to know what types beyond the built-in types are value types. This 
 is indicated via a "ValueType" declaration.

    We're going to stash some extra information in the Color Color case
    so that the binding API can return the correct information.
    
    Consider the following example:
    
    class C
    {
        public class Inner
        {
            public static C M() { return null; }

    The bound tree for "C.Inner.M()" is a bound call with a bound type 
    expression (C.Inner) as its receiver.  However, there is no bound node 
    corresponding to C.  As a result, the semantic model will attempt to 
    bind it and the binder will return F.C, since it will have no context.
    
    That's why we need to have a node for C in the (initial) bound tree.
    
    It could conceivably be useful to store other types of expressions as well
    (e.g. BoundNamespaceExpressions), but then it would be much harder to
    identify the scenarios in which this property is populated.

    When binding "name1.name2" we normally can tell what name1 is.
    
    There is however a case where name1 could be either 
    a value (field, property, parameter, local) or its type. 
    This only happens if value named exactly the same as its type - 
    famous "Color As Color".
    
    That alone is not enough to cause trouble as we can do a lookup for 
    name2 and see if it requires a receiver (then name1 is a value) 
    or if it does not (then name1 is a type).
    
    The problem only arises when name2 is an overloaded method or property.
    In such case we must defer type/value decision until overload resolution 
    selects one of the candidates.
    
    As a result we need this node that represents name1 in the state where 
    we only know its type and syntax, but do not know yet if it is a 
    Type or Value.
    
    NOTE:
    * The node can only be a qualifier of a method or a property group access 
      as only those may require overload resolution.
    * It is possible for a node of this type to appear in a tree where there
      are no errors.  Consider (Color.M is Object).  M may be overloaded to
      contain both static and instance methods.  In this case the expression is
      always *false*, but the left-hand-side of the is operator is a method
      group whose receiver is a BoundTypeOrValueExpression.

    <!-- A compound assignment operator has the following facts that must be 
         deduced about it for codegen to work. Suppose you have shorts 
         "x |= y;" That will be analyzed as "x = (short)(((int)x)|((int)y));"
         We need to know what the left hand and right hand sides are,
         what the binary operator is, how the left and right sides are
         converted to the types expected by the operator, 
         whether the operator should check for overflow, and how the 
         result of the binary operator is converted to the target 
         variable's type. We'll lower this to operations on temporaries
         before codegen.
         
         Thought we can represent the operation as these seven facts,
         in fact we can conflate three of them. We need never do the
         right-hand-side-of-the-operator conversion during the rewrite.
         We can get away with binding the conversion on the right early
         and just having the converted right operand in the bound node.
         We also conflate whether we should check for overflow with the 
         identity of the operator.
         
         This makes it a bit easier to handle the lambda case; when we have
         something like d += lambda, we want to represent the lambda in its
         bound form, not in its unbound form to be converted to the bound form
         later. This helps us maintain the invariant that non-error cases
         never produce an "unbound" lambda from the initial binding pass.

    In C# most assignments to a variable are simply writes to the
    logical variable. For example, when you say 
    
    void M(ref int x){ x = C.y }
    
    that writes the value of C.y to the variable that x is an alias for.
    It does not write the address of C.y to the actual underlying storage
    of the parameter, which is of course actually a ref to an int variable.
    However, in some codegen scenarios we need to distinguish between a
    ref local assignment and a value assignment. When you say
    
    int s = 123; s+=10;
    
    then we generate that as
    
    int s = 123; ref int addr = ref s; int sum = addr + 10; addr = sum;
    
    Note that there are two assignment to addr; one assigns the address
    of s to addr; the other assigns the value of sum to s, indirectly 
    through addr. We therefore need to disambiguate what kind of assignment
    we are doing based on something other than the refness of the left hand side.

       The input Value and the constants must be of the same type. Currently emit only supports
       integral types and string.

       BoundSwitchDispatch is also used to mark labels in the code that will be the target of backward
       branches, but should be treated as having the same stack depth as the location where
       the BoundForwardLabels appears. Although we will necessarily produce some IL instructions
       for this in order to comply with the verifier constraints, the effect of the code shall be
       a no-op. The form of the code produced will likely be something of the form
         ldc.i4.m1 // load constant -1
         switch    (
             IL_nnnn, // all of the labels of interest
             IL_nnnn,
             IL_nnnn)
       This is needed for the lowering of the pattern switch expression, which produces
       a state machine that may contain backward branches. Due to the fact that it is an expression,
       it may appear where the stack is not empty. A BoundSwitchDispatch statement (used inside of a
       BoundSequence containing the state machine) permits us to (cause the verifier to) classify
       all of the labels as forward labels by producing a dummy inoperable forward jump to them.
