# Compiler Benchmarks

This is a place for writing and sharing compiler benchmarks. The goal is to make it easy to share
benchmarks used when making compiler changes and to serve as examples for how to write benchmarks
in the future.

These will have a lower maintenance bar than our unit test infrastructure. These benchmarks are
often _point in time_ demonstrations. They are not necessarily expected to be maintained over time
in the same way a test would. If a substantial change is made to the compiler that makes a benchmark
hard to maintain it is acceptable to remove the benchmark.
