    /// For most operations the rebuild scenario does not need to provide a 
    /// <see cref="SourceReferenceResolver"/>. However the usage of #line in the program 
    /// forces our hand. 
    /// 
    /// A #line pragma which has a document argument goes through the same path normalization
    /// as other files. This is always done relative to the file which contains the #line 
    /// pragma (the containing file will be the base path).
    /// 
    /// It is possible for multiple files, in different directories, to have a #line which
    /// refers to the same file. For example lib1.cs and dir/lib2.cs can both have the following
    /// entry:
    ///
    ///     #line 42 "data.txt"
    /// 
    /// Without a resolver entry to provide a normalized path, based on the directory, it is possible
    /// these get normalized out to the same path. Particularly when pathmap is involved and we
    /// are observing unix paths in a windows rebuild (or vice versa). This is because pathmap can 
    /// create paths which are illegal to the current operating system (by design).
