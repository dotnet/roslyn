        ''' Having this binder, which is created for each field initializer within AnonymousObjectCreationExpressionSyntax
        ''' gives us the following advantages:
        '''   - We no longer rely on transient state of AnonymousTypeField objects to detect out of order field references
        '''     within initializers. This way we can be sure that result of binding performed by SemanticModel is consistent
        '''     with result of initial binding of the entire node.
        '''   - AnonymousTypeCreationBinder overrides CreateAnonymousObjectCreationExpression in such a way that it mutates
        '''     its state. That overridden method shouldn't be called while we are binding each initializer (by queries, for example), 
        '''     it should be called only by AnonymousTypeCreationBinder itself after all initializers are bound and we are producing 
        '''     the resulting node. So having an extra binder in between takes care of that.
