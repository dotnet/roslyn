    ''' <summary>
    ''' A Binder object represents a general location from where binding is happening, and provides
    ''' virtual methods for looking up unqualified names, reporting errors, and also other
    ''' operations that need to know about where binding happened from (accessibility checking,
    ''' etc.) It also contains most of the methods related to general binding of constructs,
    ''' although some large sections are factored into their own classes.
    '''
    ''' Yes, Binder is a big grab bag of features. The reason for this is that binders are threaded
    ''' through essentially ALL binding functions. So, basically Binder has all the features that
    ''' need to be threaded through binding.
    '''
    ''' Binder objects form a linked list and each binder links to its containing binder. Each
    ''' binder only handles operations that it knows how to handles, and passes on other calls to
    ''' its containing binder. This maintains separation of concerns and allows binders to be strung
    ''' together in various configurations to enable different binding scenarios (e.g., debugger
    ''' expression evaluator).
    '''
    ''' In general, binder objects should be constructed via the BinderBuilder class.
    '''
    ''' Binder class has GetBinder methods that return binders for scopes nested into the current
    ''' binder scope. One should not expect to get a binder from the functions unless a syntax that
    ''' originates a scope is passed as the argument. Also, the functions do not cross lambda
    ''' boundaries, if binder's scope contains a lambda expression, binder will not return any
    ''' binders for nodes contained in the lambda body. In order to get them, the lambda must be
    ''' bound to BoundLambda node, which exposes LambdaBinder, which can be asked for binders in the
    ''' lambda body (but it will not descend into nested lambdas). Currently, only
    ''' <see cref="ExecutableCodeBinder"/>, <see cref="MethodBodySemanticModel.IncrementalBinder"/>
    ''' and <see cref="SpeculativeBinder"/> have special implementation of GetBinder functions,
    ''' the rest just delegate to containing binder.
