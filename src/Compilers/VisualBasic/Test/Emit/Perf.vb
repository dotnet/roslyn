            ' Benchmark code can be found in the following file under the 
            ' "CompilerTestResources" project that is part of Roslyn.sln -
            '      $/Roslyn/Main/Open/Compilers/Test/Resources/Core/PerfTests/VBPerfTest.vb

            ' You can also use VS's "Navigate To" feature to find the above file easily -
            ' Just hit "Ctrl + ," and type "VBPerfTest.vb" in the dialog that pops up.

            ' Please note that if this test fails, it is likely because of a bug in the
            ' *product* and not in the *test* / *benchmark code* :)
            ' The benchmark code has been verified to compile fine against Dev10.
            ' So if the test fails we should fix the product bug that is causing the failure
            ' as opposed to 'fixing' the test by updating the benchmark code.


            ' If you absolutely need to change the benchmark code - PLEASE SHOOT A MAIL TO SHYAM (GNAMBOO)
            ' so that he can apply the same changes to the copy of this benchmark code that is used in the perf test.
