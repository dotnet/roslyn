    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' To hooks up menu items (including tool box, context menu, etc...)
    ''' -----------------------------------------------------------------
    ''' 1.    Define the menus in designerui directory
    '''       (see VSIP documents | Advanced VSPackage Support | Implementing Menu and Toolbar Commands).
    '''       -   Add some unique ID for your menu, group and command into VisualStudioEditorsID.h.
    '''       -   Add those groups, menus and commands into Menus.ctc file (see Command Table Format).
    ''' 2.    Define those constants in vbpackage\Contants.vb - MenuConstants.
    '''       Only expose the final CommandID (combination of the GUID and the command ID).
    ''' 3.    BaseRootDesigner exposes utilities methods to allow you registering menus with the shells, 
    '''       and showing context menus. 
    '''       a. For each command menu:
    '''           - Defines an EventHandler to handle the invoke of that command.
    '''           - Optional: defines functions to check if the command is Enabled or Checked.
    '''           - Defines a DesignerMenuCommand for that command.
    '''       b. Register the commands using BaseRootDesigner.RegisterMenuCommands.
    ''' 4.    In case it is a context menu, use BaseRootDesigner.ShowContextMenu to show it from the designer view.
