    ''' This is the base editor factory for all designers in this assembly.  The
    '''     editor factory provides a way for the shell to get an editor for a
    '''     particular file type.  To create a new designer type, you must also inherit from this
    '''     editor factory base.  Be sure to give each new editor factory class a different guid.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    '''     This file was copied from the frameworks: FX\src\VSDesigner\Designer\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Designer\Shell
    '''     We need our own version because the original version does not support logical views, and also because
    '''     the one from Windows Forms does not support custom DocData types.

    '''     This is the base editor factory for all designers in this assembly.  The
    '''     editor factory provides a way for the shell to get an editor for a
    '''     particular file type.  To create a new designer type, you must also inherit from this
    '''     editor factory base.  Be sure to give each new editor factory class a different guid.
    '''
    '''     Provides basic editor factory functionality for a specific designer.  Must be inherited for each 
    '''     designer type supported.  By default, only a single entry in the Open With… dialog box is shown by 
    '''     the shell for each editor factory—-therefore, in general there should be one editor factory per entry 
    '''     in the Open With… dialog.  There is one exception to this—a single designer can be made via the registry 
    '''     to have multiple entries in the Open With dialog for multiple views or encodings (e.g., “Text Editor”, 
    '''     “Text Editor with Encoding”).
    '''
    '''     ADDING A NEW DESIGNER TO THIS ASSEMBLY (this may not be all the steps required, but it'''s a start):
    '''
    '''     1) Add an editor factory—-inherit from BaseEditorFactory
    '''           a. Add a GUID attribute to the class
    '''           b. Override EditorGuide to return this GUID
    '''           c. Add registration for the file extension in the .vbgpp file (and also VBPackage, but that information
    '''                 is currently unused but might be used in the future by RegPkg), and have it point to this GUID
    '''           d. In Sub New, call MyBase.New() with the type of your designer loader class (see next step)
    '''     2) Add a designer loader—-inherit from BaseDesignerLoader
    '''           a. Override HandleLoad() to implement depersisting your data
    '''           b. Override HandleFlush() to implement persisting your data
    '''           c. Override GetBaseComponentClassName
    '''     3) Create a root component (inherits from Component, has Designer attribute), a root designer
    '''          (inherits from ComponentDesigner and implements IRootDesigner) and a view (probably inherits from
    '''           UserControl or ControlContainer)

        ''' This method is called by the Environment (inside IVsUIShellOpenDocument::
        ''' OpenStandardEditor and OpenSpecificEditor) to map a LOGICAL view to a 
        ''' PHYSICAL view. A LOGICAL view identifies the purpose of the view that is
        ''' desired (e.g. a view appropriate for Debugging [LOGVIEWID_Debugging], or a 
        ''' view appropriate for text view manipulation as by navigating to a find
        ''' result [LOGVIEWID_TextView]). A PHYSICAL view identifies an actual type 
        ''' of view implementation that an IVsEditorFactory can create. 
        '''     
        ''' NOTE: Physical views are identified by a string of your choice with the 
        ''' one constraint that the default/primary physical view for an editor  
        ''' *MUST* use a NULL string as its physical view name (*pbstrPhysicalView = NULL).
        '''     
        ''' NOTE: It is essential that the implementation of MapLogicalView properly
        ''' validates that the LogicalView desired is actually supported by the editor.
        ''' If an unsupported LogicalView is requested then E_NOTIMPL must be returned.
        '''     
        ''' NOTE: The special Logical Views supported by an Editor Factory must also 
        ''' be registered in the local registry hive. LOGVIEWID_Primary is implicitly 
        ''' supported by all editor types and does not need to be registered.
        ''' For example, an editor that supports a ViewCode/ViewDesigner scenario
        ''' might register something like the following:
        ''' HKLM\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\[CurrentVSVersion]\Editors\
        ''' {...guidEditor...}\
        ''' LogicalViews\
        ''' {...LOGVIEWID_TextView...} = s ''
