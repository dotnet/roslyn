    ''' <summary>
    ''' A special subclass of PropertyControlData that changes the behavior in the following manner:
    '''   a) If simplified configurations mode is on ("Show Advanced Build Configurations" property from
    '''     Tools.Options.Projects and Solutions" is off, and the project still has only the original
    '''     Debug and Release configurations, with no configurations having been changed, added or deleted),
    '''     then the property will only display its value from a single configuration (either Debug or
    '''     Release, as specified in the constructor), and changing that property will only affect that
    '''     single configuration.  Even if the property's value is different in the two configurations, it
    '''     will not show an indeterminate value.
    '''   b) If simplified configurations mode is not on, then we revert to default behavior (including showing
    '''     indeterminate state if multiple objects are selected and their values differ).
    ''' 
    ''' This subclass is used for certain properties that have a "natural" value in debug that differs from
    '''     the default used in Release.  If we did not use this subclass for these properties, the default
    '''     display would be indeterminate for these properties in all SKUs that use simplified configurations
    '''     (e.g., VB, C# Express, etc.).
