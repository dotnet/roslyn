Namespace Microsoft.VisualStudio.Editors.ResourceEditor

    ''' <summary>
    ''' Provides a set of ResourceTypeEditor instances for convenience.
    ''' 
    ''' *** IMPORTANT ***
    '''
    ''' You should *never* do a reference comparison against a particular resource type 
    '''   editor, because there can be different instances of them, so that doesn't 
    '''   mean a thing.  For instance, the resource type editor that you get from the
    '''   Resource class is created through TypeDescriptor.GetEditor, and it will *not*
    '''   be the same instance as those in this class.  
    ''' If you need to compare two resource editor editors (in general this shouldn't
    '''   be necessary anyway), then use ResourceTypeEditor.Equals().  It will do the
    '''   right thing.
