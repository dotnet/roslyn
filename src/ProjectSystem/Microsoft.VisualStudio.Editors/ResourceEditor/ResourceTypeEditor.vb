    ''' This class is the base class for an extensible mechanism of displaying resources in the resource editor.
    '''   Although this extensibility mechanism is not currently exposed (it can be simply by marking this
    '''   class as Public), the architecture was designed to handle this easily if we decided to publicly
    '''   expose it in a future version.

        '   documentation for this class if it is ever made public.


        ' If the resource editor decides to support a pluggable architecture, new resource type editors can be 
        '   written and registered for use with new serializable types intended for use inside a .resx file.  
        '   The pluggable editor author would subclass ResourceTypeEditor.  This is similar in concept to 
        '   UITypeEditor which Windows Forms uses to allow class authors to create custom editors for use 
        '   in the property grid.  
        '   
        '   BrianPe suggests that if we make it public, ResourceTypeEditor should be placed in a separate DLL 
        '   from Microsoft.VisualStudio.Editors.dll (where the resource editor itself lives), to provide maximum 
        '   future flexibility (perhaps we want the resource editor to be hostable from Loc Studio, for example), 
        '   and also so that assemblies which contain custom editors only have to reference the DLL with 
        '   ResourceTypeEditor, and not the larger and more arbitrary Microsoft.VisualStudio.Editors.dll.  
        '   (Note that only the custom editor assembly actually has to reference ResourceTypeEditor – the 
        '   class which the editor edits can specify type names rather than actual types and thus does not 
        '   need a reference either to the ResourceTypeEditor assembly or to the assembly with its custom 
        '   editor.)  We could either create a new DLL or look for an existing DLL with a similar function of 
        '   providing public classes for VS-related functionality.  It is also possible, if ResourceTypeEditor 
        '   is generic enough, to have it added to a frameworks class, but Brian recommends against it if 
        '   possible because of the work and scrutiny involved.
        '   
        '   To associate a custom resource type editor to a class which may live inside a .resx file, the 
        '   author uses System.ComponentModel.EditorAttribute, e.g.:
        '   
        '       <Editor(GetType(MyFunkyResourceCustomResourceEditor), GetType(ResourceTypeEditor)), _
        '         Serializable()> _
        '       Public Class MyFunkyResource
        '   	…
        '       End Class
        '   
        '   This associates the MyFunkyResourceCustomResourceEditor custom editor with the .resx-persistable 
        '   class MyFunkyResource.  The resource editor uses TypeDescriptor.GetEditor() to find the editor 
        '   associated with each resource instance in the .resx file.
        '   
        '   To ensure our pluggable architecture is working, the native types that are supported in the 
        '   resource editor (bitmap, icon, etc.) are all implemented using this same architecture.  We use 
        '   TypeDescriptor.AddEditorTable in ResourceTypeEditor’s Shared Sub New to associate our intrinsic 
        '   type editors with their corresponding types in the frameworks classes (since we own editors for 
        '   classes that we do not own, such as Bitmap and therefore can’t place an attribute directly on 
        '   the class).  Note that it is not possible for 3rd parties to use TypeDescriptor.AddEditorTable.  
        '   Since a custom type editor is associated with that resource class that it edits by placing an 
        '   attribute on the resource class, in general a custom resource type editor must be created by the 
        '   author of the resource class.  However, BrianPe tells me that in Whidbey it will be possible to 
        '   get around this limitation through a TypeDescriptionProvider which would allow a 3rd party to
        '   alter the type descriptor on a class in another assembly.
        '   
        '   When we open a .resx file, we find all custom editors for all types in that .resx (the resource 
        '   type editor for a particular resource is cached in ResXResource), and use them to add to the 
        '   list of resource categories.  However, if there are other resource type editors available but 
        '   there is no actual instance of that type in the .resx file, we would not know to add them to 
        '   the categories list.  To make it possible for programmers to create new resources of such 
        '   custom types, we would need to allow the user to specify new types to add to the categories 
        '   list.  BrianPe has suggested we create a dialog which searches through the installed SDK’s 
        '   searching for public types with custom resource type editors.  (Note: He says we can steal 
        '   similar code from the toolbox code and modify it for our use probably within a couple of 
        '   days.)  Once a type has been added to the category list, it would persist through multiple 
        '   sessions of using the VS shell until it is explicitly removed.  Once the new type is installed 
        '   in the category list, it would be possible to create a new instance of that resource type in 
        '   the .resx file using the editor.  The advantage of the dialog is that 3rd parties aren’t 
        '   required to register themselves somehow.
