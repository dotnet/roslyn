        '''  Class which provides a storage for serialization data.

        ''' <remarks>
        ''' Comments from the SerializationStore class which this derives from:
        '''
        '''      The SerializationStore class is an implementation-specific class that stores 
        '''      serialization data for the component serialization service.  The 
        '''      service adds state to this serialization store.  Once the store is 
        '''      closed it can be saved to a stream.  A serialization store can be 
        '''      deserialized at a later date by the same type of serialization service.  
        '''      SerializationStore implements the IDisposable interface such that Dispose 
        '''      simply calls the Close method.  Dispose is implemented as a private 
        '''      interface to avoid confusion.  The IDisposable pattern is provided 
        '''      for languages that support a "using" syntax like C# and VB .NET.
