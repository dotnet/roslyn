<!-- This test measures the performance of the Navigate To operation for C#.               -->
<!-- The measurement is based on code markers, so it measures the duration of the internal -->
<!-- rename to operation. As Dev11 and Roslyn implement rename very differently this test  -->
<!-- is not completely fair in the sense that Roslyn does more work to complete the same   -->
<!-- operation. In fact the amount of work needed is affected by the number of characters  -->
<!-- types. However, the point of the test is to measure the user experience and as such   -->
<!-- we consider the implementation details irrelevant in this case.                  -->
