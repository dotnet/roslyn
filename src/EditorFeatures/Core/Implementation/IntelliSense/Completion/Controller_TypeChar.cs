            //      1) send the commit character through to the buffer.

            //          2b) commit the item.
            //          2c) send the commit character through again.*
            //          2d) commit the transaction.
            //
            // 2c is very important.  it makes sure that post our commit all our normal features
            // run depending on what got typed.  For example if the commit character was (
            // then brace completion may run.  If it was ; then formatting may run.  But, importantly
            // this code doesn't need to know anything about that.  Furthermore, because that code
            // runs within this transaction, then the user can always undo and get to what the code
            // would have been if completion was not involved.
            //
            // 2c*: note sending the commit character through to the buffer again can be controlled
            // by the completion item.  For example, completion items that want to totally handle
            // what gets output into the buffer can ask for this not to happen.  An example of this
