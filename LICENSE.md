disclosing party reasonably requests to prevent any further unauthorized
use or disclosure of it. Each party expressly acknowledges and agrees
that, except as specifically provided in this Agreement, at no time
shall it acquire or retain, or appropriate for its own use, any right,
title or interest in or to any Confidential Information of the other
party.

12.2 The obligations set out in Section 12.1 shall not apply to the
extent, that any Confidential Information (i) becomes generally
available to the public through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) is
or has been disclosed to the receiving party, directly or indirectly, by
any person that is under no obligation of non-disclosure to the
disclosing party or an affiliate of the disclosing party; or (iii) is
required to be disclosed under any applicable law, rule, regulation or
governmental order.

12.3 Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, each party shall
continue to abide by the terms of the non-disclosure obligations with
respect to Confidential Information as set out in this Section and
indemnification as set out in Section 12.2 hereof.

## 13. TERMINATION

13.1 If either party materially defaults in the performance of any of
its duties or obligations under this Agreement and fails to proceed
within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof to commence curing
the default and thereafter to proceed with reasonable diligence to
substantially cure the default, the other party may, by giving written
notice thereof, terminate this Agreement effective immediately. However,
this provision does not apply to a default in payments to the Licensor
by the Licensee (no cure period is provided for such a breach and the
Licensor may terminate this Agreement effective immediately).

13.2 Except as may be prohibited by Czech bankruptcy laws, in the event
of either party's insolvency or inability to pay debts as they become
due, voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by or against a
party hereto, or appointment of a receiver or assignee for the benefit
of creditors, the other party may terminate this Agreement by written
notice.

13.3 All rights granted will cease upon any termination of this
Agreement. Within fifteen (15) days after termination of the license
rights granted herein or this Agreement for any reason, the Licensee
will destroy the original and all copies of the Software in all forms,
and will certify to the Licensor in writing that such obligation has
been fulfilled.

## 14. MARKETING

14.1 Unless agreed otherwise, the Licensee agrees to be identified as a
customer of the Licensor and that the Licensor may refer to the Licensee
by name, trade name and trademark, if applicable, and may briefly
describe the Licensee's business in the Licensor's marketing materials,
on the Licensor's website, in public or legal documents. The Licensee
hereby grants to the Licensor a license to use the Licensee's name and
any of the Licensee's trade names and trademarks solely pursuant to this
Marketing Section.

## 15. NOTICES

15.1 All notices required by or relating to this Agreement will be in
writing and will be sent by mail to the Licensor at the address set
forth on the first page of this Agreement; to the Licensee by mail or in
electronic form to the address set forth in the relevant Order; or
to such other address as either party may specify by written notice to
the other.

## 16. GENERAL

16.1 The Licensor reserves the right at any time to cease the support of
the Software and to alter prices, features, specifications,
capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general
availability or other characteristics of the Software.

16.2 The Licensee shall notify Licensor in writing, without undue delay,
of any changes in the data contained in this Agreement or any other
arrangement between the Licensor and the Licensee, or any changes
affecting the Licensee's identity or legal status, or any significant
facts and changes that relate to or might have a substantial impact upon
its transactions or business relationship with the Licensor or the
Licensee's ability to fulfil its obligations towards the Licensor or of
which the Licensor could reasonably be expected to want to be informed,
and shall submit documents evidencing such changes and other information
as the Licensor may reasonably request. Any change shall become
effective against and binding on the Licensor on the business day
following receipt of such notification, notwithstanding any information
contained in any public register. The Licensee is responsible for any
loss or damage incurred by the Licensor or the Licensee arising out of
the failure of the Licensee to duly and promptly notify the Licensor of
such changes.

16.3 Except for Site License and Global License pursuant to this
Agreement, and neither Automatic License Audit nor License Server is
used, the Licensee will at all times maintain records specifically
identifying the Software licensed under this Agreement, the location of
each copy thereof, and the location and identity of the workstations and
servers (Devices) on which the Software is installed. The Licensor may,
during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice,
conduct an audit to determine the Licensee's compliance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The Licensee will permit the Licensor
or its authorized agents to access the Licensee's facilities,
workstations and servers, and otherwise cooperate fully with the
Licensor in any such investigation and will take all commercially
reasonable actions to assist the Licensor in accurately determining the
Licensee's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

16.4 Neither party will be liable for any delay in or failure to perform
any of its non-monetary obligations under this Agreement if due to any
cause or condition beyond their reasonable control, whether foreseeable
or not.

16.5 This Agreement, the relevant Order, the then current Price List and
the then current Specifications of the Software, and possibly also other
arrangements related to the Software agreed between the parties in
writing, as the case may be, constitute the entire agreement between the
parties concerning the Software. Any reference to Licensee's terms and
conditions or any other general terms and conditions included in
Licensee's order or in any other communication shall in no event apply
to the contractual relationship between the parties hereto and shall
have no legal effect.

16.6 The Software includes functionality that when utilized by Licensee
may enable temporary access to sensitive data such as passwords or
credit card numbers in diagnostic logs and audit servers ("Diagnostic
Data"). Licensee does not monitor the content processed by the Software
and Licensor is responsible for properly configuring the Software to
manage Diagnostic Data and obtaining any required consents to provide
access to the Diagnostic Data and disclaims any liability for Licensee's
use of the Software in violation of applicable security and privacy
laws.

16.7 Nothing in this Agreement shall create a partnership or a
corporation between the parties, nor deem either party the agent of the
other party for any purpose.

***16.8 If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or
unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the
remaining provisions of this Agreement. The parties are committed to
cooperate on replacing the invalid or unenforceable provision with a
valid and enforceable one which will achieve the same economic result
(to the maximum extent legally possible) as the provision which is or
has become invalid or unenforceable.***

16.9 If the wording or sense of any provision of this Agreement implies
that the obligation(s) stipulated therein shall last after the
termination of the Agreement, the parties are obliged to comply with
such obligation(s) after the termination of the Agreement. In
particular, the parties are obliged to protect the Confidential
Information and its confidential character even after the termination of
the Agreement.

17.10 For the avoidance of any doubts the parties explicitly confirm
they are business entities and enter in the Agreement as businesses and
therefore neither the provisions of S. 1693 of the Civil Code
(disproportionate shortening) nor S. 1696 of the Civil Code (usury)
shall be applied hereto.

17.11 This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance
with the laws of the Czech Republic without regard to the conflict of
law principles thereof. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled by the courts of
the Czech Republic. In accordance with Section 89a of Act No. 99/1963
Coll., the Czech Civil Procedure Code, the parties hereby agree that the
competent court shall be the general court nearest to where the Licensor
is registered, e.g. the Prague Commerce Tribunal.
