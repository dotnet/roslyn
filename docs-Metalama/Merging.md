# Merging from new Roslyn branches

## 1. Find the source Roslyn version and branch

Check the versions of Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset NuGet package. In the descrption of each version, you can find the commit from which the version was built. The commit then corresponds to a certain branch.

Alternatively, you can find the branch at https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/releases. Several releases may share the same branch and version there.

Examples:
version 3.8.0, commit https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/8de9e4b2beba5b7c0edd6f1e6a4f192a51fdc872, branch release/dev16.8-vs-deps
version 3.11.0, commit https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/ae1fff344d46976624e68ae17164e0607ab68b10, branch release/dev16.11-vs-deps

## 3. Update eng-Metalama\MainVersions.props
