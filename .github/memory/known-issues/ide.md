# IDE — Known Issues

Layer-specific quirks for the IDE/Workspaces stack. Load when working under
`src/{Analyzers,CodeStyle,Features,Workspaces,EditorFeatures,VisualStudio,LanguageServer}`.
Cross-cutting issues live in `.github/memory/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

## MEF composition failures surface as test failures

**Affected area:** MEF-dependent IDE/Workspaces tests
**Description:** A missing/incorrect MEF export attribute often manifests as an
unrelated-looking test failure rather than a clear composition error.
**Workaround:** When IDE tests fail unexpectedly, check the export attributes
first (`[ExportLanguageService]`/`[ExportWorkspaceService]`, `[Shared]`,
`[ImportingConstructor]` + `[Obsolete(MefConstruction.ImportingConstructorMessage)]`).

## FileTextLoader does not watch files

**Affected area:** Workspaces backed by files outside a regular project
**Description:** `FileTextLoader` reads from disk when its text is first requested, but the
result is cached in the immutable solution snapshot. It does not invalidate that snapshot when
the file changes.
**Workaround:** Register a file watcher that updates the workspace with a new text loader. The
standard project-system path does this when adding files through `ProjectSystemProject`.
