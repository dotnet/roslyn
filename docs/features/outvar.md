Out Variable Declarations
=========================

The *out variable declaration* feature enables a variable to be declared at the location that it is being passed as an `out` argument.

```antlr
argument_value
    : 'out' type identifier
    | ...
    ;
```

A variable declared this way is called an *out variable*. 
You may use the contextual keyword `var` for the variable's type.
The scope will be the same as for a *pattern-variable* introduced via pattern-matching.

According to Language Specification (section 7.6.7 Element access)
The argument-list of an element-access is not allowed to contain ref or out arguments.
However, due to backward compatibility, compiler overlooks this restriction during parsing
and even ignores out/ref modifiers in element access during binding.
We will enforce that language rule for out variables declarations at the syntax level.

Within the scope of a local variable introduced by a local-variable-declaration, 
it is a compile-time error to refer to that local variable in a textual position 
that precedes its declaration. 

It is also an error to reference implicitly-typed (ยง8.5.1) out variable in the same argument list that immediately 
contains its declaration.

For the purposes of overload resolution (see sections 7.5.3.2 Better function member and 7.5.3.3 Better conversion from expression),
neither conversion is considered better when corresponding argument is an implicitly-typed out variable declaration.
Once overload resolution succeeds, the type of implicitly-typed out variable is set to be equal to the type of the 
corresponding parameter in the signature of the method.

The new syntax node `DeclarationExpressionSyntax` is added to represent the declaration in an out var argument.
