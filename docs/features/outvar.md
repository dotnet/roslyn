Out Variable Declarations
=========================

The *out variable declaration* feature enables a variable to be declared at the location that it is being passed as an `out` argument.

```antlr
argument_value
    : 'out' type identifier
    | ...
    ;
```

A variable declared this way is called an *out variable*. 
You may use the contextual keyword `var` for the variable's type.
The scope will be the same as for a *pattern-variable* introduced via pattern-matching.

According to Language Specification (section 7.6.7 Element access)
the argument-list of an element-access (indexing expression)
does not contain ref or out arguments.
However, they are permitted by the compiler for various scenarios, for example indexers
declared in metadata that accept `out`.

Within the scope of a local variable introduced by a local-variable-declaration, 
it is a compile-time error to refer to that local variable in a textual position 
that precedes its declaration. 

It is also an error to reference implicitly-typed (ยง8.5.1) out variable in the same argument list that immediately 
contains its declaration.

Overload resolution is modified as follows:

We add a new conversion:

> There is a *conversion from expression* from an implicitly-typed out variable declaration to every type.

Also

> The type of an explicitly-typed out variable argument is the declared type.

and

> An implicitly-typed out variable argument has no type.

Neither conversion from expression is better when the argument is an implicitly-typed out variable declaration. (this needs to be woven into the form of the specification) 

The type of an implicitly-typed out variable is the type of the corresponding parameter in the signature of the method.

The new syntax node `DeclarationExpressionSyntax` is added to represent the declaration in an out var argument.
