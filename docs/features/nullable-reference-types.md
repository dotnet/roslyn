Nullable Reference Types
=========
Reference types may be nullable, non-nullable, or null-oblivious (abbreviated here as `?`, `!`, and `~`).

## Setting project level nullable context

Project level nullable context can be set by using "nullable" command line switch:
-nullable[+|-]                        Specify nullable context option enable|disable.
-nullable:{enable|disable|safeonly|warnings|safeonlywarnings}   Specify nullable context option enable|disable|safeonly|warnings|safeonlywarnings.

Through msbuild the context could be set by supplying an argument for a "NullableContextOptions" parameter of Csc build task.
Accepted values are "enable", "disable", "safeonly", "warnings", "safeonlywarnings", or null (for the default nullable context according to the compiler).
The Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets passes value of msbuild property named "NullableContextOptions" for that parameter.

## Annotations
In source, nullable reference types are annotated with `?`.
```c#
string? OptString; // may be null
Dictionary<string, object?>? OptDictionaryOptValues; // dictionary may be null, values may be null
```
A warning is reported when annotating a reference type with `?` outside a `#nullable` context.

In metadata, nullable reference types are annotated with a `[Nullable]` attribute.
```c#
namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
{
    [AttributeUsage(
        AttributeTargets.Class |
        AttributeTargets.GenericParameter |
        AttributeTargets.Event | AttributeTargets.Field | AttributeTargets.Property |
        AttributeTargets.Parameter | AttributeTargets.ReturnValue,
        AllowMultiple = false)]
    public sealed class NullableAttribute : Attribute
    {
        public NullableAttribute(byte b) { }
        public NullableAttribute(byte[] b) { }
    }
}
```

Each type reference is accompanied by a NullableAttribute with an array of bytes, where 0 is Oblivious, 1 is NotAnnotated and 2 is Annotated.
All value types are marked with flag 0 (oblivious).

To optimize trivial cases the attribute can be omitted, or instead can be replaced with an attribute that takes a single byte value rather than an array.  

Trivial/optimized cases:
1)	All parts are NotAnnotated – a NullableAttribute with a single value 1 (rather than an array of 1s)
2)	All parts are Annotated - a NullableAttribute with a single value 2 (rather than an array of 2s)
3)	All parts are Oblivious – the attribute is omitted, this matches how we interpret the lack of an attribute in legacy assemblies.
    For completeness, we would also recognize a NullableAttribute with a single value 0 (rather than an array of 0s),
    but compiler will never emit an attribute like this. 

NullableAttribute(1) should be placed on a type parameter definition that has a `class!` constraint.
NullableAttribute(2) should be placed on a type parameter definition that has a `class?` constraint.
Other forms of NullableAttribute are not emitted on type parameter definitions and are not specially recognized on them.

The `NullableAttribute` type declaration is synthesized by the compiler if it is not included in the compilation, but is needed to produce the output.

```c#
// C# representation of metadata
[Nullable(2)]
string OptString; // string?
[Nullable(new[] { 2, 1, 2 })]
Dictionary<string, object> OptDictionaryOptValues; // Dictionary<string!, object?>?
string[] Oblivious1; // string~[]~
[Nullable(0)] string[] Oblivious2; // string~[]~
[Nullable(new[] { 0, 0 })] string[] Oblivious3; // string~[]~
[Nullable(1)] string[] NotNull1; // string![]!
[Nullable(new[] { 1, 1 })] string[] NotNull2; // string![]!
[Nullable(new[] { 0, 2 })] string[] ObliviousMaybeNull; // string?[]~
[Nullable(new[] { 1, 2 })] string[] NotNullMaybeNull; // string?[]!
int Int; // int
Nullable<int> NullableInt1; // Nullable<int>
```
## Declaration warnings
_Describe warnings reported for declarations in initial binding._

## Flow analysis
Flow analysis is used to infer the nullability of variables within executable code. The inferred nullability of a variable is independent of the variable's declared nullability.
Method calls are analyzed even when they are conditionally omitted. For instance, `Debug.Assert` in release mode.

### Warnings
_Describe set of warnings. Differentiate W warnings._
If the analysis determines that a null check always (or never) passes, a hidden diagnostic is produced. For example: `"string" is null`.

### Null tests
A number of null checks affect the flow state when tested for:
- comparisons to `null`: `x == null` and `x != null`
- `is` operator: `x is null`, `x is K` (where `K` is a constant), `x is string`, `x is string s`

Invocation of methods annotated with the following attributes will also affect flow analysis:
- `[NotNullWhenTrue]` (e.g. `TryGetValue`) and `[NotNullWhenFalse]` (e.g. `string.IsNullOrEmpty`)
- `[EnsuresNotNull]` (e.g. `ThrowIfNull`)
- `[AssertsTrue]` (e.g. `Debug.Assert`) and `[AssertsFalse]`

## `default`
If `T` is a reference type, `default(T)` is `T?`.
```c#
string? s = default(string); // assigns ?, no warning
string t = default; // assigns ?, warning
```
If `T` is a value type, `default(T)` is `T` and any non-value-type fields in `T` are maybe null.
If `T` is a value type, `new T()` is equivalent to `default(T)`.
```c#
struct Pair<T, U> { public T First; public U Second; }
var p = default(Pair<object?, string>); // ok: Pair<object?, string!> p
p.Second.ToString(); // warning
(object?, string) t = default; // ok
t.Item2.ToString(); // warning
```
If `T` is an unconstrained type parameter, `default(T)` is a `T` that is maybe null.
```c#
T t = default; // warning
```
_Is `default(T?)` an error?_

### Conversions
Conversions can be calculated with ~ considered distinct from ? and !, or with ~ implicitly convertible to ? and !.
Given `IIn<in T>` and `IOut<out T>`, with ~ distinct:
- `T!` is a `T~` is a `T?`
- `IIn<T!>` is a `IIn<T~>` is a `IIn<T?>`
- `IOut<T?>` is a `IOut<T~>` is a `IOut<T!>`
Most conversions are considered with ~ implicitly convertible to ? and !.

_Describe warnings from user-defined conversions._

### Assignment
For `x = y`, the nullability of the converted type of `y` is used for `x`.
A warning is reported if there is a mismatch between top-level or nested nullability comparing the inferred nullability of `x` and the declared type of `y`.
The warning is a W warning when assigning `?` to `!` and the target is a local.
```c#
notNull = maybeNull; // assigns ?, warning
notNull = oblivious; // assigns ~, no warning
oblivious = maybeNull; // assigns ?, no warning
```

### Local declarations
Nullablilty follows from assignment above. Assigning `?` to `!` is a W warning.
```c#
string notNull = maybeNull; // assigns ?, warning
```
Nullability of `var` declarations is determined from flow analysis.
```c#
var s = maybeNull; // s is ?, no warning
if (maybeNull == null) return;
var t = maybeNull; // t is !
```

### Suppression operator (`!`)
The postfix `!` operator sets the top-level nullability to non-nullable. Conversions on a suppressed expression produce no nullability warnings.
```c#
var x = optionalString!; // x is string!
var y = obliviousString!; // y is string!
var z = new [] { optionalString, obliviousString }!; // no change, z is string?[]!
```
A warning is reported when using the `!` operator absent a `NonNullTypes` context.

Unnecessary usages of `!` do not produce any diagnostics, including `!!`.

A suppressed expression `e!` can be target-typed if the operand expression `e` can be target-typed.

### Explicit cast
Explicit cast to `?` changes top-level nullability.
Explicit cast to `!` does not change top-level nullability and may produce W warning.
```c#
var x = (string)maybeNull; // x is string?, W warning
var y = (string)oblivious; // y is string~, no warning
var z = (string?)notNull; // y is string?, no warning
```
A warning is reported if the type of operand including nested nullability is not explicitly convertible to the target type.
```c#
sealed class MyList<T> : IEnumerable<T> { }
var x =  new MyList<string?>();
var y = (IEnumerable<object>)x;  // warning
var z = (IEnumerable<object?>)x; // no warning
```

### Method type inference

We modify the spec rule for [Fixing](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/expressions.md#fixing "Fixing") to take account of types that may be equivalent (i.e. have an identity conversion) yet may not be identical in the set of bounds. The existing spec says (third bullet)

> If among the remaining candidate types `Uj` there is a unique type `V` from which there is an implicit conversion to all the other candidate types, then `Xi` is fixed to `V`.

This is not correct for C# 5 (i.e., it is a bug in the language specification), as it fails to handle bounds such as `Dictionary<object, dynamic>` and `Dictionary<dynamic, object>`, which are merged to `Dictionary<dynamic, dynamic>`. This is [an open issue](https://github.com/ECMA-TC49-TG2/spec/issues/951) that we anticipate will be addressed in the next iteration of the ECMA specification.  Handling nullability properly will require additional changes beyond those in that next iteration of the ECMA spec.

When adding to the set of exact bounds of a type parameter, types that are equivalent (i.e. have an identity conversion) but not identical are merged using *invariant* rules.  When adding to the set of lower bounds of a type parameter, types that are equivalent but not identical are merged using *covariant* rules.  When adding to the set of upper bounds of a type parameter, types that are equivalent but not identical are merged using *contravariant* rules.  In the final fixing step, types that are equivalent but not identical are merged using *covariant* rules.

Merging equivalent but not identical types is done as follows:

#### Invariant merging rules

- Merging `dynamic` and `object` results in the type `dynamic`.
- Merging tuple types that differ in element names is specified elsewhere.
- Merging equivalent types that differ in nullability is performed as follows: merging the types `Tn` and `Um` (where `n` and `m` are differing nullability annotations) results in the type `Vk` where `V` is the result of merging `T` and `U` using the invariant rule, and `k` is as follows:
 - if either `n` or `m` are non-nullable, non-nullable.
 - if either `n` or `m` are nullable, nullable.
 - otherwise oblivious.
- Merging constructed generic types is performed as follows: Merging the types `K<A1, A2, ...>` and `K<B1, B2, ...>` results in the type `K<C1, C2, ...>` where `Ci` is the result of merging `Ai` and `Bi` by the invariant rule.
- Merging tuple types `(A1, A2, ...)` and `(B1, B2, ...)` results in the type `(C1, C2, ...)` where `Ci` is the result of merging `Ai` and `Bi` by the invariant rule.
- Merging the array types `T[]` and `U[]` results in the type `V[]` where `V` is the result of merging `T` and `U` by the invariant rule.

#### Covariant merging rules

- Merging `dynamic` and `object` results in the type `dynamic`.
- Merging tuple types that differ in element names is specified elsewhere.
- Merging equivalent types that differ in nullability is performed as follows: merging the types `Tn` and `Um` (where `n` and `m` are differing nullability annotations) results in the type `Vk` where `V` is the result of merging `T` and `U` using the covariant rule, and `k` is as follows:
 - if either `n` or `m` are nullable, nullable.
 - if either `n` or `m` are oblivious, oblivious.
 - otherwise non-nullable.
- Merging constructed generic types is performed as follows: Merging the types `K<A1, A2, ...>` and `K<B1, B2, ...>` results in the type `K<C1, C2, ...>` where `Ci` is the result of merging `Ai` and `Bi` by
  - the invariant rule if `K`'s type parameter in the `i` position is invariant.
  - the covariant rule if `K`'s type parameter in the `i` position is declared `out`.
  - the contravariant rule if the `K`'s type parameter in the `i` position is declared `in`.
- Merging tuple types `(A1, A2, ...)` and `(B1, B2, ...)` results in the type `(C1, C2, ...)` where `Ci` is the result of merging `Ai` and `Bi` by the covariant rule.
- Merging the array types `T[]` and `U[]` results in the type `V[]` where `V` is the result of merging `T` and `U` by the invariant rule.

#### Contravariant merging rules

- Merging `dynamic` and `object` results in the type `dynamic`.
- Merging tuple types that differ in element names is specified elsewhere.
- Merging equivalent types that differ in nullability is performed as follows: merging the types `Tn` and `Um` (where `n` and `m` are differing nullability annotations) results in the type `Vk` where `V` is the result of merging `T` and `U` using the contravariant rule, and `k` is as follows:
 - if either `n` or `m` are non-nullable, non-nullable.
 - if either `n` or `m` are oblivious, oblivious.
 - otherwise nullable.
- Merging constructed generic types is performed as follows: Merging the types `K<A1, A2, ...>` and `K<B1, B2, ...>` results in the type `K<C1, C2, ...>` where `Ci` is the result of merging `Ai` and `Bi` by
  - the invariant rule if `K`'s type parameter in the `i` position is invariant.
  - the covariant rule if `K`'s type parameter in the `i` position is declared `in`.
  - the contravariant rule if `K`'s type parameter in the `i` position is declared `out`.
- Merging tuple types `(A1, A2, ...)` and `(B1, B2, ...)` results in the type `(C1, C2, ...)` where `Ci` is the result of merging `Ai` and `Bi` by the contravariant rule.
- Merging the array types `T[]` and `U[]` results in the type `V[]` where `V` is the result of merging `T` and `U` by the invariant rule.

It is intended that these merging rules are associative and commutative, so that a compiler may merge a set of equivalent types pairwise in any order to compute the final result.

> ***Open issue***: these rules do not describe the handling of merging a nested generic type `K<A>.L<B>` with `K<C>.L<D>`. That should be handled the same as a hypothetical type `KL<A, B>` would be merged with `KL<C, D>`.

> ***Open issue***: these rules do not describe the handling of merging pointer types.

### Array creation
The calculation of the _best type_ element nullability uses the Conversions rules above and the covariant merging rules.
```c#
var w = new [] { notNull, oblivious }; // ~[]!
var x = new [] { notNull, maybeNull, oblivious }; // ?[]!
var y = new [] { enumerableOfNotNull, enumerableOfMaybeNull, enumerableOfOblivious }; // IEnumerable<?>!
var z = new [] { listOfNotNull, listOfMaybeNull, listOfOblivious }; // List<~>!
```

### Null-coalescing operator
The top-level nullability of `x ?? y` is `!` if `x` is `!` and otherwise the top-level nullability of `y`.
A warning is reported if there is a nested nullability mismatch between `x` and `y`.

## Type parameters
A `class?` constraint is allowed, which, like class, requires the type argument to be a reference type, but allows it to be nullable.
[Nullable strawman](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/790)
[4/25/18](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/meetings/2018/LDM-2018-04-25.md)

An explicit `object` (or `System.Object`) constraint is allowed, which requires the type to be non-nullable when it is a reference type.
However, an explicit `object?` constraint is not allowed.
An unconstrained type parameter is essentially equivalent to one constrained by `object?`.
[4/25/18](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/meetings/2018/LDM-2018-04-25.md)
Note, the `object`/`System.Object` constraint is represented in metadata as any other type constraint, the type is System.Object.


A warning is reported for nullable type argument for type parameter with `class` constraint or non-nullable reference type or interface type constraint.
[4/25/18](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/meetings/2018/LDM-2018-04-25.md)
```c#
static void F1<T>() where T : class { }
static void F2<T>() where T : Stream { }
static void F3<T>() where T : IDisposable { }
F1<Stream?>(); // warning
F2<Stream?>(); // warning
F3<Stream?>(); // warning
```
Type parameter constraints may include nullable reference type and interface types.
[4/25/18](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/meetings/2018/LDM-2018-04-25.md)
```c#
static void F2<T> where T : Stream? { }
static void F3<T>() where T : IDisposable? { }
F2<Stream?>(); // ok
F3<Stream?>(); // ok
```
A warning is reported for inconsistent top-level nullability of constraint types.
[4/25/18](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/meetings/2018/LDM-2018-04-25.md)
```c#
static void F4<T> where T : class, Stream? { } // warning
static void F5<T> where T : Stream?, IDisposable { } // warning
```
An error is reported for duplicate constraints where constraints are compared ignoring top-level and nested nullability.
```c#
class C<T> where T : class
{
    static void F1<U>() where U : T, T? { } // error: duplicate constraint
    static void F2<U>() where U : I<T>, I<T?> { } // error: duplicate constraint
}
```
_What are the rules for annotated (unannotated) type arguments for generic type parameters from unannotated (annotated) types and methods?_
```c#
[NotNullTypes(false)] List<T> F1<T>(T t) where T : class { ... }
[NotNullTypes(true)]  List<T> F2<T>(T t) where T : class { ... }
[NotNullTypes(true)]  List<T?> F3<T>(T? t) where T : class { ... }
var x = F1(notNullString);   // List<string!> or List<string~> ?
var y = F1(maybeNullString); // List<string?> or List<string~> ?
var z = F2(obliviousString); // List<string~>! or List<string!>! ?
var w = F3(obliviousString); // List<string~>! or List<string?>! ?
```
A warning is reported for dereferencing variables of type T, where T is an unconstrained type parameter.
```C#
static void F<T>(T t) => t.ToString(); // Warn possible null dereference
```
A warning is reported when attempting to convert a null, default, or potentially null value to an unconstrained type parameter.
```C#
static T F<T>() => default; // Warn converting default to T
```

## Object creation
An error is reported for creating an instance of a nullable reference type.
```c#
new C?(); // error
new List<C?>(); // ok
```

## Public APIs
There are a few questions that an API consumer would want to answer:
1. should I print a `?` after the type?
2. can I assign a `null` value to a variable of this type?
3. could I read a `null` value from a variable of this type?

Two primitive concepts we wish to expose are: `IsAnnotated` and `NonNullTypes`.
_We may expose some higher-level concepts (to address questions 2 and 3 conveniently) as well._

|  | IsAnnotated |
|--| ----------- |
| `string?` | `true` |
| `int?` / `Nullable<int>` | `true` (_needs confirmation_) |
| `Nullable<T>` | `true` |
| `T? where T : class` | `true` |
| `T? where T : struct` | `true` (_needs confirmation_) |
| `string` | `false` |
| `int` | `false` |
| `T where T : class/object` | `false` |
| `T where T : class?` | `false` |
| `T where T : struct` | `false` |
| `T` | `false` |
