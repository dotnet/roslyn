This is a checklist (moved from #9375) of implementation of pattern matching as specified in [patterns.md](./patterns.md). For reference a previous prototype was at https://github.com/semihokur/pattern-matching-csharp

Open design issues (needing LDM decisions)
- [ ] There would be an ambiguity with a hypothetical "type pattern" and the constant pattern. This is the reason we do not allow the latter in an is-pattern expression, and don't allow the former in a sub-property pattern. But that is irregular. Can we come up with name lookup rules that support both?
  - [ ] If we support `3 is 3`, is that a constant expression? Can a `match` expression be constant?
  - [ ] Can we support `{ PropName is Type }` in a property pattern?
- [ ] Do we want pattern-matching in the `switch` statement? Or do we want a separate statement-based construct instead? (#8821)
    - [ ] What does `goto case` mean?
      - [ ] Do we limit `goto case` to constants?
      - [ ] Or do we allow a non-constant expression in a `goto case` statement?
      - [ ] If limited to constants, must its value match an existing constant label?
      - [ ] Can a constant `case` label with a `when` clause be the target of `goto case`?
    - [ ] How do we write the rules for the switch-expression (conversion) and matching labels (i.e. constant patterns) so that it approximates the current behavior?
    - [ ] Do we allow multiple cases in the same `switch` block if one of them defines a pattern variable?
- [ ] What syntax do we want for the `match` expression? (#8818)
  - [ ] Does a `match` expression have to be complete? If not, what happens? Warning? Exception? Both?
  - [ ] What about the `case` expression?
- [ ] Under what condition do we give diagnostics for pattern-matching based on subsumption or completion? See http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/norman-ramsey/match.pdf for a discussion of implementation approaches. We probably need to select (and specify?) an approach.
- [ ] Should we combine the property pattern with the type pattern so as to allow giving the object a name? If so, what syntax?
- [ ] What do we think about the let statement?
  - [ ] Do we require the match be irrefutable? If not, do we give a warning? Or let definite-assignment issues alert the user to any problems?
  - [ ] Do we support an else?
  - [ ] Is there a compatibility issue? (e.g. if the user has a type named `let`) 
- [ ] There are some scoping questions for pattern variables. #9452
  - [ ] Need to get LDM approval for design change around scope of pattern variables declared within a constructor initializer #9452 
  - [ ] Also questions about multiple field initializers, local initializers, ctor-initializers (how far does the scope extend?)
- [ ] Need detailed spec for name lookup of property in a property pattern #9255
  - [ ] [Pattern Matching] Should a property-pattern be capable of referencing an event? #9515
- [x] Two small clarifications need to be integrated into the spec (#7703)
- [ ] We need to specify and implement the user-defined pattern forms: user-defined `operator is`?
  - [ ] static void with self-receiver
  - [ ] static bool for active patterns
  - [ ] instance bool for captured data (regex)
- [ ] Do we want to support "breakpoints inside" patterns (#9095)?
- [ ] Do we want to support named "arguments" in recursive patterns? e.g. `if (p is Point(X: 3, Y: 4)) ...`
- [ ] What is the correct precedence of *throw-expression*? Should *assignment* be allowed as its sub-expression?
- [ ] @jaredpar suggested that, by analogy with the integral types, we should match floating-point literal patterns across floating-point types.
- [ ] Should we allow throw expression on right of && and || ? #9453
- [ ] Should `operator is` be allowed to take a ref first parameter, for example for value types? Is the answer the same as for all other operators?
- [ ] We need to specify the meaning of the things we need the decision tree for: subsumption, completeness, irrefutable.
- [ ] Will we support pattern matching with anonymous types?
- [ ] Will we support pattern matching with arrays?
- [ ] Will we support pattern matching with List<T>, Dictionary<K, V>?
- [ ] How should the type `dynamic` interact with pattern matching?
- [ ] In what situations should the compiler be required by specification to warn about a match that must fail? E.g. switch on a `byte` but case label is out of range?
- [ ] Should it be possible to name the whole matched thing in a property pattern, like `case Point p { X is 2 }:` ?

- [x] Match constant patterns with appropriate integral conversions (#8819)
- [ ] **Add a decision tree** to enable

  - [ ] subsumption checking: a branch of a switch statement or match expression may not be subsumed by the totality of previous branches (#8823)
  - [ ] irrefutable: a pattern that *always* matches given its context.
  - [ ] Generate efficient code like `switch` does in corresponding situations. (#8820)
- [ ] Test `operator is` across assembly boundaries.
