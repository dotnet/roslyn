This is a checklist (moved from #9375) of implementation of pattern matching as specified in [patterns.md](./patterns.md). For reference a previous prototype was at https://github.com/semihokur/pattern-matching-csharp

Open design issues (needing LDM decisions)
- [ ] Do we want pattern-matching in the switch statement? If so, what does “goto case” mean? Or do we want a separate statement-based construct instead? (#8821)
- [ ] What syntax do we want for the match expression? (#8818)
- [ ] Do they have to be complete? If not, what happens? Warning and exception?
- [ ] Under what condition do we give diagnostics for pattern-matching based on subsumption or completion? See http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/norman-ramsey/match.pdf for a discussion of implementation approaches.
- [ ] Should we combine the property pattern with the type pattern so as to allow giving the object a name? If so, what syntax?
- [ ] What do we think about the let statement?
- [ ] There are some scoping questions for pattern variables. #9452
  - [ ] Need to get LDM approval for design change around scope of pattern variables declared within a constructor initializer #9452 
  - [ ] Also questions about multiple field initializers, local initializers, ctor-initializers (how far does the scope extend?)
- [ ] Need detailed spec for name lookup of property in a property pattern #9255
  - [ ] [Pattern Matching] Should a property-pattern be capable of referencing an event? #9515
- [ ] Two small clarifications need to be integrated into the spec (#7703)
- [ ] We need to specify and implement the user-defined pattern forms: user-defined `operator is`
  - [ ] static void with self-receiver
  - [ ] static bool for active patterns
  - [ ] instance bool for captured data (regex)
  - [ ] Do we want to support "breakpoints inside" patterns (#9095)

Progress checklist:
- [ ] Add a decision tree to enable
  - [ ] completeness checking: a mutli-armed pattern-matching expression is required to be complete
  - [ ] subsumption checking: a branch of a switch statement or match expression may not be subsumed by the totality of previous branches (#8823)
  - [ ] Generate efficient code like `switch` does in corresponding situations. (#8820)
- [X] Scoping for variables introduced in patterns (binders)
- [x] `SemanticModel.GetDeclaredSymbol` for pattern variable declarations.
- [X] Simple pattern matching expressions `expression is Type Identifier` in most statements.
- [x] Extend the parser to handle all of the other specified pattern-matching operations.
  - [x] Add tests for the parser, including precedence tests for the edge cases.
  - [ ] Augment `TestResource.AllInOneCSharpCode` to handle all pattern forms.
- [x] Check for feature availability in the parser (error if feature not supported).
- [X] Error pattern matching to a nullable value type
- [x] Implement pattern matching to a type that is an unconstrained type variable (requires a double type test)
- [ ] Implement and test scoping in remaining "odd" contexts (where the scope is not the enclosing statement)
  - [x] pattern matching in ctor-initializers
  - [x] pattern matching in catch filters
  - [x] pattern matching in field initializers
  - [x] pattern matching in expression-bodied methods and properties
  - [x] pattern matching in an expression-bodied lambda
  - [x] pattern matching in an expression-bodied local function
  - [x] pattern matching in attributes and parameter defaults (lookup and error recovery)
  - [x] test these "odd" contexts in `SemanticModel`.
- [ ] Semantics and code-gen for all pattern forms
  - [X] Type ID
  - [x] *
  - [x] 3
    - [X] matching with exact type for integral constants (as a short-term hack)
    - [ ] matching with appropriate integral conversions (#8819)
  - [x] `var` ID
  - [x] Type { ID is Pattern ... }
  - ~~Type ( Pattern ... )~~ This will be done when Records are integrated.
- [ ] Extend the switch statement to handle patterns
  - [x] Parser
  - [ ] Syntax Tests
  - [x] Binding
  - [ ] Binding (failure cases) tests
  - [x] Flow analysis
  - [x] Lowering
  - [x] Code-gen tests
- [ ] Allow declaration of `operator is`
- [x] An expression form for mutli-armed pattern-matching (`match`?)
- [ ] Extend the scope of a pattern variable declared in a catch filter to the catch block. (#8814)
- [ ] Implement and test pattern variable scoping for all statements (#8817)
  - [ ] Test for error on reusing a variable name, and lambda-capturing.
- [ ] Test for name conflicts with locals in enclosing scopes for normal and "odd" contexts.
- [ ] Need a custom diagnostic for accessing a static property in a property pattern. Are there other contexts where the diagnostics need improvement?
- [ ] Data-flow analysis and region analysis should be modified to handle pattern variables, which are definitely assigned when a pattern match succeeds.
  - [ ] Region analysis APIs versus pattern matching #9277 
  - [ ] Can't extract method on case expression in match/case clause. #9105
  - [ ] Consider pattern matching for extract method scenarios #9244
  - [ ] PreciseAbstractFlowPass doesn't override visit for BoundMatchCase and BoundConstantPattern nodes #9422 
- [ ] Control-flow analysis should be modified to handle patterns that either always match or never match.
- [ ] Lots more Tests and code coverage; #9542
  - [ ] Tests for error cases in a property pattern, such as when the named member
    - [X] Does not exist
    - [X] Is static
    - [ ] Is an event
    - [ ] Is a method
    - [ ] Is an indexed property
    - [ ] Is a nested type
    - [X] In inaccessible
    - [ ] Does not exist
- [ ] `IOperation` support for pattern-matching (#8699)
