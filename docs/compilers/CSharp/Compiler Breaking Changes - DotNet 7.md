# This document lists known breaking changes in Roslyn after .NET 6 all the way to .NET 7.

## Types cannot be named `scoped`

***Introduced in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4.*** Starting in C# 11, types cannot be named `scoped`. The compiler will report an error on all such type names. To work around this, the type name and all usages must be escaped with an `@`:

```csharp
class scoped {} // Error CS9056
class @scoped {} // No error
```

```csharp
ref scoped local; // Error
ref scoped.nested local; // Error
ref @scoped local2; // No error
```

This was done as `scoped` is now a modifier for variable declarations and reserved following `ref` in a ref type.

## Types cannot be named `file`

***Introduced in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4.*** Starting in C# 11, types cannot be named `file`. The compiler will report an error on all such type names. To work around this, the type name and all usages must be escaped with an `@`:

```csharp
class file {} // Error CS9056
class @file {} // No error
```

This was done as `file` is now a modifier for type declarations.

You can learn more about this change in the associated [csharplang issue](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/6011).

## Required spaces in #line span directives

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.400, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3.***

When the `#line` span directive was introduced in C# 10, it required no particular spacing.  
For example, this would be valid: `#line(1,2)-(3,4)5"file.cs"`.

In Visual Studio 17.3, the compiler requires spaces before the first parenthesis, the character
offset, and the file name.  
So the above example fails to parse unless spaces are added: `#line (1,2)-(3,4) 5 "file.cs"`.

## Checked operators on System.IntPtr and System.UIntPtr

***Introduced in .NET SDK 7.0.100, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3.***

When the platform supports __numeric__ `IntPtr` and `UIntPtr` types (as indicated by the presence of
`System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeFeature.NumericIntPtr`) the built-in operators from `nint`
and `nuint` apply to those underlying types.
This means that on such platforms, `IntPtr` and `UIntPtr` have built-in `checked` operators, which
can now throw when an overflow occurs.

```csharp
IntPtr M(IntPtr x, int y)
{
    checked
    {
        return x + y; // may now throw
    }
}

unsafe IntPtr M2(void* ptr)
{
    return checked((IntPtr)ptr); // may now throw
}
```

Possible workarounds are:

1. Specify `unchecked` context
2. Downgrade to a platform/TFM without numeric `IntPtr`/`UIntPtr` types

Also, implicit conversions between `IntPtr`/`UIntPtr` and other numeric types are treated as standard
conversions on such platforms. This can affect overload resolution in some cases.

## Nameof operator in attribute on method or local function

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.400, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3.***

When the language version is C# 11 or later, a `nameof` operator in an attribute on a method
brings the type parameters of that method in scope. The same applies for local functions.  
A `nameof` operator in an attribute on a method, its type parameters or parameters brings
the parameters of that method in scope. The same applies to local functions, lambdas,
delegates and indexers.

For instance, these will now be errors:
```csharp
class C
{
  class TParameter
  {
    internal const string Constant = """";
  }
  [MyAttribute(nameof(TParameter.Constant))]
  void M<TParameter>() { }
}
```

```csharp
class C
{
  class parameter
  {
    internal const string Constant = """";
  }
  [MyAttribute(nameof(parameter.Constant))]
  void M(int parameter) { }
}
```

Possible workarounds are:

1. Rename the type parameter or parameter to avoid shadowing the name from outer scope.
1. Use a string literal instead of the `nameof` operator.

## Cannot return an out parameter by reference

***Introduced in .NET SDK 7.0.100, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3.***

With language version C# 11 or later, or with .NET 7.0 or later, an `out` parameter cannot be returned by reference.

```csharp
static ref T ReturnOutParamByRef<T>(out T t)
{
    t = default;
    return ref t; // error CS8166: Cannot return a parameter by reference 't' because it is not a ref parameter
}
```

A possible workaround is to change the method signature to pass the parameter by `ref` instead.

```csharp
static ref T ReturnRefParamByRef<T>(ref T t)
{
    t = default;
    return ref t; // ok
}
```

## Method ref struct return escape analysis depends on ref escape of ref arguments

***Introduced in .NET SDK 7.0.100, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3.***

With language version C# 11 or later, or with .NET 7.0 or later, the return value of a method invocation that returns a `ref struct` is only _safe-to-escape_ if all the `ref` and `in` arguments to the method invocation are _ref-safe-to-escape_. _The `in` arguments may include implicit default parameter values._

```csharp
ref struct R { }

static R MayCaptureArg(ref int i) => new R();

static R MayCaptureDefaultArg(in int i = 0) => new R();

static R Create()
{
    int i = 0;
    // error CS8347: Cannot use a result of 'MayCaptureArg(ref int)' because it may expose
    // variables referenced by parameter 'i' outside of their declaration scope
    return MayCaptureArg(ref i);
}

static R CreateDefault()
{
    // error CS8347: Cannot use a result of 'MayCaptureDefaultArg(in int)' because it may expose
    // variables referenced by parameter 'i' outside of their declaration scope
    return MayCaptureDefaultArg();
}
```

A possible workaround, if the `ref` or `in` argument is not captured in the `ref struct` return value, is to declare the parameter as `scoped ref` or `scoped in`.

```csharp
static R CannotCaptureArg(scoped ref int i) => new R();

static R Create()
{
    int i = 0;
    return CannotCaptureArg(ref i); // ok
}
```

## Unsigned right shift operator

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.400, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3.***
The language added support for an "Unsigned Right Shift" operator (`>>>`).
This disables the ability to consume methods implementing user-defined "Unsigned Right Shift" operators
as regular methods.
 
For example, there is an existing library developed in some language (other than VB or C#)
that exposes an "Unsigned Right Shift" user-defined operator for type ```C1```.
The following code used to compile successfully before:
``` C#
static C1 Test1(C1 x, int y) => C1.op_UnsignedRightShift(x, y); //error CS0571: 'C1.operator >>>(C1, int)': cannot explicitly call operator or accessor
``` 

A possible workaround is to switch to using `>>>` operator:
``` C#
static C1 Test1(C1 x, int y) => x >>> y;
``` 

## Foreach enumerator as a ref struct

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.300, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.2.*** A `foreach` using a ref struct enumerator type reports an error if the language version is set to 7.3 or earlier.

This fixes a bug where the feature was supported in newer compilers targeting a version of C# prior to its support.

Possible workarounds are:

1. Change the `ref struct` type to a `struct` or `class` type.
1. Upgrade the `<LangVersion>` element to 7.3 or later.

## Async `foreach` prefers pattern based `DisposeAsync` to an explicit interface implementation of `IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync()`

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.300, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.2.*** An async `foreach` prefers to bind using a pattern-based `DisposeAsync()` method rather than `IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync()`.

For instance, the `DisposeAsync()` will be picked, rather than the `IAsyncEnumerator<int>.DisposeAsync()` method on `AsyncEnumerator`:

```csharp
await foreach (var i in new AsyncEnumerable())
{
}

struct AsyncEnumerable
{
    public AsyncEnumerator GetAsyncEnumerator() => new AsyncEnumerator();
}

struct AsyncEnumerator : IAsyncDisposable
{
    public int Current => 0;
    public async ValueTask<bool> MoveNextAsync()
    {
        await Task.Yield();
        return false;
    }
    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("PICKED");
        await Task.Yield();
    }
    ValueTask IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync() => throw null; // no longer picked
}
```

This change fixes a spec violation where the public `DisposeAsync` method is visible on the declared type, whereas the explicit interface implementation is only visible using a reference to the interface type.

To workaround this error, remove the pattern based `DisposeAsync` method from your type.

## Disallow converted strings as a default argument

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.300, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.2.*** The C# compiler would accept incorrect default argument values involving a reference conversion of a string constant, and would emit `null` as the constant value instead of the default value specified in source. In Visual Studio 17.2, this becomes an error. See [roslyn#59806](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/59806).

This change fixes a spec violation in the compiler. Default arguments must be compile time constants. Previous versions allowed the following code:

```csharp
void M(IEnumerable<char> s = "hello")
```

The preceding declaration required a conversion from `string` to `IEnumerable<char>`. The compiler allowed this construct, and would emit `null` as the value of the argument. The preceding code produces a compiler error starting in 17.2.

To work around this change, you can make one of the following changes:

1. Change the parameter type so a conversion isn't required.
1. Change the value of the default argument to `null` to restore the previous behavior.

## The contextual keyword `var` as an explicit lambda return type

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.200, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1.*** The contextual keyword var cannot be used as an explicit lambda return type.

This change enables [potential future features](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/meetings/2021/LDM-2021-06-02.md#lambda-return-type-parsing) by ensuring that the `var` remains the natural type for the return type of a lambda expression.

You can encounter this error if you have a type named `var` and define a lambda expression using an explicit return type of `var` (the type).

```csharp
using System;

F(var () => default);  // error CS8975: The contextual keyword 'var' cannot be used as an explicit lambda return type
F(@var () => default); // ok
F(() => default);      // ok: return type is inferred from the parameter to F()

static void F(Func<var> f) { }

public class var
{
}
```

Workarounds include the following changes:

1. Use `@var` as the return type.
1. Remove the explicit return type so that the compiler determines the return type.

## Interpolated string handlers and indexer initialization

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.200, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1.*** Indexers that take an interpolated string handler and require the receiver as an input for the constructor cannot be used in an object initializer.

This change disallows an edge case scenario where indexer initializers use an interpolated string handler and that interpolated string handler takes the receiver of the indexer as a parameter of the constructor. The reason for this change is that this scenario could result in accessing variables that haven't yet been initialized. Consider this example:

```csharp
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

// error: Interpolated string handler conversions that reference
// the instance being indexed cannot be used in indexer member initializers.
var c = new C { [$""] = 1 }; 

class C
{
    public int this[[InterpolatedStringHandlerArgument("")] CustomHandler c]
    {
        get => ...;
        set => ...;
    }
}

[InterpolatedStringHandler]
class CustomHandler
{
    // The constructor of the string handler takes a "C" instance:
    public CustomHandler(int literalLength, int formattedCount, C c) {}
}
```

Workarounds include the following changes:

1. Remove the receiver type from the interpolated string handler.
1. Change the argument to the indexer to be a `string`

## ref, readonly ref, in, out not allowed as parameters or return on methods with Unmanaged callers only

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.200, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1.*** `ref`/`ref readonly`/`in`/`out` are not allowed to be used on return/parameters of a method attributed with `UnmanagedCallersOnly`.

This change is a bug fix. Return values and parameters aren't blittable. Passing arguments or return values by reference can cause undefined behavior. None of the following declarations will compile:

```csharp
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
[UnmanagedCallersOnly]
static ref int M1() => throw null; // error CS8977: Cannot use 'ref', 'in', or 'out' in a method attributed with 'UnmanagedCallersOnly'.

[UnmanagedCallersOnly]
static ref readonly int M2() => throw null; // error CS8977: Cannot use 'ref', 'in', or 'out' in a method attributed with 'UnmanagedCallersOnly'.

[UnmanagedCallersOnly]
static void M3(ref int o) => throw null; // error CS8977: Cannot use 'ref', 'in', or 'out' in a method attributed with 'UnmanagedCallersOnly'.

[UnmanagedCallersOnly]
static void M4(in int o) => throw null; // error CS8977: Cannot use 'ref', 'in', or 'out' in a method attributed with 'UnmanagedCallersOnly'.

[UnmanagedCallersOnly]
static void M5(out int o) => throw null; // error CS8977: Cannot use 'ref', 'in', or 'out' in a method attributed with 'UnmanagedCallersOnly'.
```

The workaround is to remove the by reference modifier.

## Length, Count assumed to be non-negative in patterns

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.200, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1.*** `Length` and `Count` properties on countable and indexable types
are assumed to be non-negative for purpose of subsumption and exhaustiveness analysis of patterns and switches.
Those types can be used with implicit Index indexer and list patterns.

The `Length` and `Count` properties, even though typed as `int`, are assumed to be non-negative when analyzing patterns. Consider this sample method:

```csharp
string SampleSizeMessage<T>(IList<T> samples)
{
    return samples switch
    {
        // This switch arm prevents a warning before 17.1, but will never happen in practice.
        // Starting with 17.1, this switch arm produces a compiler error.
        // Removing it won't introduce a warning.
        { Count: < 0 }    => throw new InvalidOperationException(),
        { Count:  0 }     => "Empty collection",
        { Count: < 5 }    => "Too small",
        { Count: < 20 }   => "reasonable for the first pass",
        { Count: < 100 }  => "reasonable",
        { Count: >= 100 } => "fine",
    };
}

void M(int[] i)
{
    if (i is { Length: -1 }) {} // error: impossible under assumption of non-negative length
}
```

Prior to 17.1, The first switch arm, testing that `Count` is negative was necessary to avoid a warning that all possible values weren't covered. Starting with 17.1, the first switch arm generates a compiler error. The workaround is to remove the switch arms added for the invalid cases.

This change was made as part of adding list patterns. The processing rules are more consistent if every use of a `Length` or `Count` property on a collection are considered non-negative. You can read more details about the change in the [language design issue](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/5226).

The workaround is to remove the switch arms with unreachable conditions.

## <a name="6"></a> Adding field initializers to a struct requires an explicitly declared constructor

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.200, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1.*** `struct` type declarations with field initializers must include an explicitly declared constructor. Additionally, all fields must be definitely assigned in `struct` instance constructors that do not have a `: this()` initializer so any previously unassigned fields must be assigned from the added constructor or from field initializers. See [dotnet/csharplang#5552](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/5552), [dotnet/roslyn#58581](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/58581).

There are two ways to initialize a variable to its default value in C#: `new()` and `default`. For classes, the difference is evident since `new` creates a new instance and `default` returns `null`. The difference is more subtle for structs, since for `default`, structs return an instance with each field/property set to its own default. We added field initializers for structs in C# 10. Field initializers are executed only when an explicitly declared constructor runs. Significantly, they don't execute when you use `default` or create an array of any `struct` type.

In 17.0, if there are field initializers but no declared constructors, a parameterless constructor is synthesized that runs field initializers. However, that meant adding or removing a constructor declaration may affect whether a parameterless constructor is synthesized, and as a result, may change the behavior of `new()`.

To address the issue, in .NET SDK 6.0.200 (VS 17.1) the compiler no longer synthesizes a parameterless constructor. If a `struct` contains field initializers and no explicit constructors, the compiler generates an error. If a `struct` has field initializers it must declare a constructor, because otherwise the field initializers are never executed.

Additionally, all fields that do not have field initializers must be assigned in each `struct` constructor unless the constructor has a `: this()` initializer.

For instance:

```csharp
struct S // error CS8983: A 'struct' with field initializers must include an explicitly declared constructor.
{
    int X = 1; 
    int Y;
}
```

The workaround is to declare a constructor. Unless fields were previously unassigned, this constructor can, and often will, be an empty parameterless constructor:

```csharp
struct S
{
    int X = 1;
    int Y;

    public S() { Y = 0; } // ok
}
```

## Format specifiers can't contain curly braces

***Introduced in .NET SDK 6.0.200, Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1.*** Format specifiers in interpolated strings can not contain curly braces (either `{` or `}`). In previous versions `{{` was interpreted as an escaped `{` and `}}` was interpreted as an escaped `}` char in the format specifier. Now the first `}` char in a format specifier ends the interpolation, and any `{` char is an error.

This makes interpolated string processing consistent with the processing for `System.String.Format`:

```csharp
using System;
Console.WriteLine($"{{{12:X}}}");
//prints now: "{C}" - not "{X}}"
```

`X` is the format for uppercase hexadecimal and `C` is the hexadecimal value for 12.

The workaround is to remove the extra braces in the format string.

You can learn more about this change in the associated [roslyn issue](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/57750).

## Types cannot be named `required`

***Introduced in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3.*** Starting in C# 11, types cannot be named `required`. The compiler will report an error on all such type names. To work around this, the type name and all usages must be escaped with an `@`:

```csharp
class required {} // Error CS9029
class @required {} // No error
```

This was done as `required` is now a member modifier for properties and fields.

You can learn more about this change in the associated [csharplang issue](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/3630).
