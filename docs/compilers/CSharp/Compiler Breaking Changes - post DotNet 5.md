## This document lists known breaking changes in Roslyn after .NET 5.

1. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/46044 In C# 9.0 (Visual Studio 16.9), a warning is reported when assigning `default` to, or when casting a possibly `null` value to a type parameter type that is not constrained to value types or reference types. To avoid the warning, the type can be annotated with `?`.
    ```C#
    static void F1<T>(object? obj)
    {
        T t1 = default; // warning CS8600: Converting possible null value to non-nullable type
        t1 = (T)obj;    // warning CS8600: Converting possible null value to non-nullable type

        T? t2 = default; // ok
        t2 = (T?)obj;    // ok
    }
    ```

2. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/50755 In .NET 5.0.200 (Visual Studio 16.9), if there is a common type between the two branches of a conditional expression, that type is the type of the conditional expression.

   This is a breaking change from 5.0.103 (Visual Studio 16.8) which due to a bug incorrectly used the target type of the conditional expression as the type even if there was a common type between the two branches.

   This latest change aligns the compiler behavior with the C# specification and with versions of the compiler before .NET 5.0.
    ```C#
    static short F1(bool b)
    {
        // 16.7, 16.9          : CS0266: Cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'short'
        // 16.8                : ok
        // 16.8 -langversion:8 : CS8400: Feature 'target-typed conditional expression' is not available in C# 8.0
        return b ? 1 : 2;
    }

    static object F2(bool b, short? a)
    {
        // 16.7, 16.9          : int
        // 16.8                : short
        // 16.8 -langversion:8 : CS8400: Feature 'target-typed conditional expression' is not available in C# 8.0
        return a ?? (b ? 1 : 2);
    }
    ```
