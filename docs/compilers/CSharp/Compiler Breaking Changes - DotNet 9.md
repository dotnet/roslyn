## Iterators introduce safe context in C# 13 and newer

***Introduced in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11***

Although the language spec states that iterators introduce a safe context, Roslyn does not implement that in C# 12 and lower.
This will change in C# 13 as part of [a feature which allows unsafe code in iterators](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72662).
The change does not break normal scenarios as it was disallowed to use unsafe constructs directly in iterators anyway.
However, it can break scenarios where an unsafe context was previously inherited into nested local functions, for example:

```cs
unsafe class C // unsafe context
{
    System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M() // an iterator
    {
        yield return 1;
        local();
        void local()
        {
            int* p = null; // allowed in C# 12; error in C# 13
        }
    }
}
```

You can work around the break simply by adding the `unsafe` modifier to the local function.
