## Implicit enum conversions from zero

From [ยง10.2.4](http://csharpstandard/standard/conversions.md#1024-implicit-enumeration-conversions):

> An implicit enumeration conversion permits a *constant_expression* ([ยง11.21](http://csharpstandard/standard/expressions.md#1121-constant-expressions)) with any integer type and the value zero to be converted to any *enum_type* and to any *nullable_value_type* whose underlying type is an *enum_type*.

Roslyn performs implicit enumeration conversions from constant expressions with types of `float`, `double` and `decimal` as well:

```csharp
enum SampleEnum
{
    Zero = 0,
    One = 1
}

class EnumConversionTest
{
    const float ConstFloat = 0f;
    const double ConstDouble = 0d;
    const decimal ConstDecimal = 0m;

    static void PermittedConversions()
    {
        SampleEnum floatToEnum = ConstFloat;
        SampleEnum doubleToEnum = ConstDouble;
        SampleEnum decimalToEnum = ConstDecimal;
    }
}
```

Conversions are (correctly) *not* permitted from constant expressions which have a type of `bool`, other enumerations, or reference types.
