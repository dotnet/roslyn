### Notes

IVariableDeclarationOperation:
 - What does scripting do for using local declarations in IOperation?

VariableDeclarationKind
 - Is Default the right kind? Should we use Other instead?
 - Documentation on Default isn't great because everything is also a declaration
 - Should we add other kinds for foreach, pattern, using statement
 - Action: Add new parent node to represent IUsingDeclarationOperation to parent the IVariableDeclarationGroupOperation, remove VariableDeclarationKind

Simplifier.AddImportsAnnotation
 - Should we use `Using` or `Imports`?
 - We have existing precedent for using C# where in conflict, but the existing stuff around using also uses Imports. We'll stick with the name

Are we holding these meetings too late?
 - Probably. We should look at holding these before ask mode ends in the future, rather than monthy.
