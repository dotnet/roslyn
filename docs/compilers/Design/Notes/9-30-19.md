 - We should probably maintain this API
 - Just forward to the old implementation

 - CanApplyParseOptionChange going from virtual protected to virtual public is a source and binary breaking change
 - We should look at having a new non-virtual public method on Workspace and forward to this API.

SyntaxFactory.AnonymousMethodExpression
 - Added overload with multiple parameters
 - Followup on usage

Formatter.OrganizeUsings
 - Should make cancellationtoken optional?
 - Need to followup with framework on what the current guidelines are
 - Make this default for now
