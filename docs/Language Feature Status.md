Language Feature Status
=====

This document reflects the status, and planned work in progress, for the compiler team.  It is a live document
and will be updated as work progresses, features are added / removed, and as work on feature progresses.
This is not an exhaustive list of our features but rather the ones which have active development
efforts behind them.

# FAQ

- **Is target version a guarantee?**: No.  It's explicitly not a guarantee.  This is just the planned and ongoing work to the best of our knowledge at this time.
- **Where are these State values defined?**: Take a look at the [Developing a Language Feature](contributing/Developing%20a%20Language%20Feature.md) document.
