Language Feature Status
=====

This document reflects the status, and planned work in progress, for the compiler team.  It is a live document
and will be updated as work progresses, features are added / removed, and as work on feature progresses.
This is not an exhaustive list of our features but rather the ones which have active development
efforts behind them.

The "Feature" column contains a link to the championed proposal or doc for the feature.  
The "State" column contains a link to the test plan issue for the feature. The test plan should have a "Feature - XYZ" label, which is also used on PRs and issues for the feature.  

# Working Set C#

Merged features should be in the bottom portion of the table (in descending order from earliest to latest merged), while in-progress features should be in the top portion of the table.  
When a feature is merged to the `main` branch, its entry should be moved to the bottom of the table and its "State" value should be updated to record the relevant version number.
