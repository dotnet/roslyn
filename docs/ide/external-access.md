# External Access Policies

## OmniSharp

When a change needs to be made to an API in the ExternalAccess.OmniSharp or ExternalAccess.OmniSharp.CSharp packages, ping @333fred, @JoeRobich, @filipw, or @david-driscoll as a heads up. Breaking changes are allowed, but please wait for acknowledgement and followup questions to ensure that we don't completely break OmniSharp scenarios.
