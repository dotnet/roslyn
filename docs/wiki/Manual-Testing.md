# Purpose of this document

This document is meant to be a comprehensive list of Roslyn features for use in several kinds of testing.
- [**Routine Product Testing**](#routineproducttesting)
- [**Release Testing**](#releasetesting)
- [**New Language Feature Testing**](#newlanguagefeaturetesting)

## <a name="routineproducttesting">Routine Product Testing</a>
- Primarily focused on features marked with a :mag:

## <a name="releasetesting">Release Testing</a>
- Test all product features in all languages

## <a name="newlanguagefeaturetesting">New Language Feature Testing</a>

- Test phases
    - **Merge Signoff**: Can the language feature be merged?
        - Critical IDE features in the areas of **Typing**, **Navigating**, and **Viewing** must function as expected. Any non-trivial issues in these areas block language feature merging.
            - These are marked with a :fast_forward:.
        - All product features have been considered/tested are free of crashes, asserts, and hangs.
            -All issues discovered (even non-crash/non-blocking) must be filed and linked here.
                - _All feature descriptions and testing suggestions are merely examples. Each language feature should be carefully considered independently against each IDE feature to find interesting intersections_
    - **Feature Signoff**: Per-feature signoff with links to non-blocking issues.
    - **Feature Suggestions**: What can we add to the product to make the new language feature delightful to use?

- Testing approaches
    - Read the **feature specification** and related conversations
    - Think about how the new language feature **interacts with each product feature**
        - Are new keywords visualized appropriately?
        - Do refactorings and fixes produce correct code utilizing the new language feature?
        - How do IDE error recovery scenarios work?
        - Do things work well across languages?
        - How is perf on large/medium/small solutions? Are features properly cancellable?
        - Etc.
    - **Brainstorm ideas** for new features to enhance the language feature
        - Should existing code be refactored to some new pattern?
        - Should users be able to easily switch between two equivalent forms?
        - Do we need to make the flow of this feature easier to visualize?
        - Etc.

# Testing tags

### Project System & External Integration

## Interaction with other new language features in the IDE
