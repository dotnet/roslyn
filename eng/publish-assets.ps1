# Publishes our build assets to nuget, myget, dotnet/versions, etc ..
#
# The publish operation is best visioned as an optional yet repeatable post build operation. It can be
# run anytime after build or automatically as a post build step. But it is an operation that focuses on
# build outputs and hence can't rely on source code from the build being available
#
# Repeatable is important here because we have to assume that publishes can and will fail with some
# degree of regularity.
