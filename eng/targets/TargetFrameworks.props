    This props file manages the target framework properties for Roslyn. The strategy for these properties
    is covered in "docs/contributing/target-framework-strategy.md". Please see that for documentation
    on what these values mean.

    Requirements:
      - NetVSShared must include both NetVS and NetVSCode
      - NetRoslynSourceBuild must include NetRoslyn
      - NetRoslynAll must include all .NET Core TFMS in any property below
  -->
  <PropertyGroup>
    <NetRoslyn>net10.0</NetRoslyn>
    <NetRoslynAll>net8.0;net10.0</NetRoslynAll>
    <NetVS>net8.0</NetVS>
    <NetVSCode>net10.0</NetVSCode>
    <NetVSShared>net8.0</NetVSShared>
    <NetRoslynBuildHostNetCoreVersion>net8.0</NetRoslynBuildHostNetCoreVersion>
    <NetRoslynNext>net10.0</NetRoslynNext>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <!--
    These are the modes that are needed for our source build TFMs and this is where we calculate them
  -->
  <Choose>
    <!--
      Source build the product: this is the all up build of the product which needs only NetCurrent
    -->
    <When Condition="'$(DotNetBuildSourceOnly)' == 'true'">
      <PropertyGroup>
        <NetRoslyn>$(NetCurrent)</NetRoslyn>
        <NetRoslynSourceBuild>$(NetCurrent)</NetRoslynSourceBuild>
        <NetRoslynAll>$(NetCurrent)</NetRoslynAll>
        <NetRoslynBuildHostNetCoreVersion>$(NetCurrent)</NetRoslynBuildHostNetCoreVersion>
        <NetRoslynNext>$(NetCurrent)</NetRoslynNext>
      </PropertyGroup>
    </When>

    <!--
      Everything else including normal CI, developer machines and official builds. This brings in enough
      TFM that source build will go smoothly but doesn't bring in all source build TFMs to avoid adding
      too many extra compiles to our builds
    -->
    <Otherwise>
      <PropertyGroup>
        <NetRoslynSourceBuild>$(NetRoslynAll)</NetRoslynSourceBuild>
      </PropertyGroup>
    </Otherwise>
  </Choose>
</Project>
