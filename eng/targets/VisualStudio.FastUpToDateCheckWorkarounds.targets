  <!-- The 9.0 Arcade targets we are consuming don't have Sets specified for the items, and don't include all items correctly. This overrides
       those targets so they don't interfere. These two empty targets can be deleted when we've removed the support from Arcade in favor of
       built-in support in the VS SDK, and we are consuming that support in this repo. -->
