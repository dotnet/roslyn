The .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn") provides open-source C# and Visual Basic compilers 
with rich code analysis APIs.  It enables building code analysis tools with the same APIs 
that are used by Visual Studio.

### Try new language and IDE features

Just want to provide feedback on new [language features](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Languages-features-in-C%23-6-and-VB-14) 
and [IDE features](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2014/11/12/the-c-and-visual-basic-code-focused-ide-experience.aspx)? 

* Try out [Visual Studio 2015 Preview](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs), 
which has the latest features built-in.

    Want to keep your box clean? You can use 
[prebuilt Azure VM images](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/06/04/visual-studio-14-ctp-now-available-in-the-virtual-machine-azure-gallery.aspx) 
with VS 2015 Preview already installed.

* You can also try April's [End User Preview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394641), 
which installs on top of Visual Studio 2013. *(Note: The VS 2013 preview is quite out of date, and is no longer being updated.)*

### Build tools that understand C# and Visual Basic

Get started building diagnostics, code fixes, refactorings, and other code-aware tools!

Click on the version of Visual Studio you are using for installation instructions.

- [**Visual Studio 2015 Preview**](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Visual-Studio-2015-Preview)

- [**Visual Studio 2015 CTP 5**](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Visual-Studio-2015-CTP-5)

- [**Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6**](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Visual-Studio-2015-CTP-6)

Or, you can grab the latest [NuGet Roslyn compiler package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis). 
From the NuGet package manager console:

    Install-Package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis -Pre
