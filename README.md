## Caravela.Compiler

The Caravela compiler is a fork of [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) (the C# compiler) which allows you to execute "source transformers". Source transformers are similar to [source generators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/), except that they allow any changes to the source code, not just additions.
